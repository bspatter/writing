Dynamics of an acoustically-driven liquid-gas interface

Interactions between acoustic waves and liquid-gas interfaces occur in
a variety of applications, including diagnostic ultrasound of the
lung. We hypothesize that, because of the sharp density gradient at
the fluid discontinuity, acoustic waves may generate sufficient
baroclinic vorticity to appreciably deform liquid-gas interfaces. This
nonlinear effect has been studied for shock-accelerated interfaces and
as the Rictmyer-Meshkov instability, however it is not describable
through traditional, linear acoustic methods and is not well studied
for acoustic waves. To investigate our hypothesis, we simulate an
inviscid, compressible fluid system with acoustic waves impinging from
water into air. We find that acoustic waves capable of deforming the
interface during wave-interaction period will deposit lasting
baroclinic vorticity along the interface, capable of driving
deformation that continues long after the passage of the wave. We use
dimensional analysis to describe the dependence of the late-time
interface growth on the deposited vorticity. Lastly, we show results
to demonstrate that for acoustic waves with properties relevant to
diagnostic ultrasound encountering a water-air interface, nearly all
of the vorticity is generated in gas-dominated fluid. We explain this
using an order of magnitude analysis.
