    \item Lung Hemorrhage (LH) is the only known bioeffect of non-contrast DUS%
    \item Has been shown to occur in mice, rats, pigs, rabbits, monkeys \citep{Child1990,OBrien1997a,Tarantal1994a}.%
    \item DUS-induced LH does not appear to be a result of cavitation or heating.%
    \item The underlying physical damage mechanism is not understood.%

    The basic physical problem we have in the lungs is a mechanical wave interacting with a gas-tissue interface.

  \note{
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item DUS-induced LH isn't new.
    \item Has been shown to occur under clinically safe conditions in a variety of mammals
    \item Isn't a result of typical US bioeffect mechanisms
    \item Physical damage mechanism isn't understood.
