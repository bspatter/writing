    \begin{itemize}
    \item Vorticity initially deposits in air-dominated $(y_0<0.5)$
      fluid of the interface.
    \item As the interface evolves, some vorticity advects with it.
    \end{itemize}

  \note{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A linear scale that changes each timestep is used for visual
      reasons.
    \item Air-domination is surprising because almost all of the wave
      is reflected so most of energy of the fluid stays in the water
      because of the high impedance mismatch.
