  Summary:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item I studied the interaction of finite-duration acoustic waves with gas-liquid interfaces.
  \end{itemize}

  Conclusions
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Baroclinic vorticity generated by wave-interface interaction is likely capable of deforming perturbed liquid-gas interfaces.\vfill%
  \item Circulation remaining after the wave determines the long term dynamics.
  \item Circulation deposition depends on interface morphology.
  \item Changes in the acoustic waveform that have little affect on
    the interface during the wave-interface interaction can
    substantially affect post-wave interface dynamics, via
    vorticity.\vfill%
  \item Baroclinic vorticity is deposited at the interface, predominantly in gas-dominated ($y_0<0.5$) fluids.\vfill%
  \item Interface responses are qualitatively similar for trapezoidal US waves.
  \end{itemize}
