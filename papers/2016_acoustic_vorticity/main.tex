\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:introduction}%

\ac{DUS} is one of the safest forms of medical imaging and has become
ubiquitous in clinical practice. However it has been demonstrated to
cause \ac{LH} in a variety of mammals. While the problem does not
appear to be one of medical concern under typical clinical conditions,
the underlying physical mechanism is not well understood and more
information is needed. 

Over the last few decades \ac{DUS}-induced \ac{LH} has been studied
extensively and is the only known bioeffect of non-contrast, pulsed
\ac{US} known to occur in mammals under clinically relevant
conditions. While it has been not been directly demonstrated in
humans, it has been shown to occur in a variety of mammals including
mice, rats, rabbits, pigs, and monkeys
\citep{Child1990,OBrien2006a,Tarantal1994a,Miller2012}.
\ac{DUS}-induced \ac{LH} does not appear to be caused by traditionally
expected \ac{US} bioeffects mechanisms. Typically, \ac{US} bioeffects
mechanisms are classified as thermal or non-thermal with the bulk of
non-thermal bioeffects being a result of acoustic
\ac{IC}. \cite{Zachary2006} finds that \ac{DUS}-induced lung lesions
are different from induced by heat and concludes that thermal
mechanisms are not likely to be the cause. \cite{OBrien2000} observes
that the severity of \ac{DUS}-induced \ac{LH} in mice increases under
raised hydrostatic pressure, and \cite{Raeman1996} finds that the
\ac{LH} is unaffected by the introduction of \ac{US} contrast
agents. Both of these findings are inconsistent with \ac{IC}-induced
hemorrhage. One study reports detecting cavitation during
\ac{DUS}-lung interaction in rats \cite{Holland1996}. \cite{Tjan2007}
consider another potential damage mechanism, that focused \ac{US} may
lead to the ejection of droplets capable of puncturing the air-filled
sacs within the lung. To investigate this, they a develop
potential-flow solution for an inviscid, free surface subjected to a
Gaussian velocity potential and show that the proposed droplet
ejection may occur under certain circumstances. \cite{Simon2012}
observed \ac{HIFU} induced atomization of tissue at air
interfaces. Other studies have used experiments and nonlinear modeling
to look at possible nonlinear effects of ultrasound in
tissue. \cite{Khokhlova1997} used spectral methods to model
propagation of plane waves in soft tissue to study nonlinear
attenuation and wave propagation during
\ac{HIFU}. \cite{Khokhlova2005} numerically solved a KZK-type equation
to simulate the \ac{HIFU} field in a tissue phantom with the purpose
of studying the impact of nonlinear phenomena on lesion formation.
Despite these efforts, the precise damage mechanism underlying
\ac{DUS}-induced \ac{LH} is still unknown. The aim of this work is to
investigate a possible physical mechanism for \ac{DUS}-induced
\ac{LH}. 

The proposed damage mechanism is based on the idea that acoustic waves
are capable generating baroclinic vorticity at a perturbed fluid-fluid
interface, which is capable of then driving the interface to
deform. There has been extensive research into the fundamental physics
describing interactions between mechanical waves, acceleration, and
fluid-fluid interfaces. Much of this research is motivated by
applications in fusion energy and astrophysics and accordingly has
sought to investigate regimes outside of those of acoustic
interests. \cite{Taylor1950} predicted that for an interface between
two fluids of different density, if the fluid was accelerated normal
to the interface in the heavy-to-light direction, perturbations at the
interface would grow. That is to say that a ``bubble'' of light fluid
penetrates the heavy fluid, and a ``spike'' of heavy fluid penetrates
the light fluid. This is known as the \ac{RTI}. A similar topic of
past study is the \ac{RMI}, which occurs when a perturbed fluid-fluid
interface is instantaneously accelerated by a shock, causing the
interface perturbation to grow \citep{Brouillette2002,Drake2006}. This
growth is driven by a sheet of baroclinic vorticity deposited along
the interface as a result of misalignment between the pressure
gradient across the shock and the density gradient across the
perturbed interface. This physical mechanism by which these misaligned
gradients create a torque on fluid particles and generate vorticity
can be thought of in terms of a hydrostatic balance upon a
particle. Pressure gradients result in acceleration of the flow that
is inversely proportional to density. When these two gradients are
misaligned, the result is a shearing effect on the fluid and vorticity
is generated. A graphical explanations of baroclinic vorticity
generation and the resulting interface deformation can be found in
\citep{Heifetz2015}. Analytically, baroclinic vorticity generation can
be shown by taking the curl of the conservation of momentum equation
for a compressible fluid. However we note that it is a nonlinear
effect and cannot be explained by traditional linear acoustics.

The physics of the \ac{RMI} are fairly well understood. For the
classical \ac{RMI} setup a planar shock impinges normally upon the
peaks and troughs of a sinusoidal interface. The interface is
accelerated non-uniformly counter-rotating vorticies are generated
across the interface. This drives peaks and troughs of the interface
to accelerate in the opposite direction. Much like in the case of the
\ac{RTI} instability, this too results in light fluid penetrating the
heavy fluid and vice versa. For the case of a wave moving from a light
fluid into a heavy one, the peaks and troughs of the interface
accelerate away from one another, growing the interface perturbation
perturbation. For the case of a wave moving from a heavy fluid to a
lighter fluid, the peaks and troughs interface initially accelerate
toward one another. They then pass each, inverting the phase of the
interface perturbation, and continue moving in opposite directions,
growing the perturbation amplitude.

Previous studies of the \ac{RMI} have utilized theory, computation,
and experiments to describe the behavior of the interface after the
wave has passed. \cite{Richtmyer1960} performed the linear stability
perturbation analysis developed by \cite{Taylor1950} for the case of
an impulsive acceleration to create a model for the initial growth of
the interface perturbation. \cite{Meshkov1969} experimentally
confirmed Richtmyer's qualitative predictions, hence the name of the
instability. \cite{Meyer1972} performed numerical simulations of the
\ac{RMI} and found good agreement with Richtmyer for the case of a
shock impinging upon a light-heavy interface. \cite{Fraley1986} used
Laplace transforms in order to find the first analytical solution for
the asymptotic growth rate for a shocked interface between perfect
gases. To describe the late time, nonlinear growth of the
perturbation, \cite{Zhang1997} used single mode perturbation, keeping
many high order terms, to describe the velocity of the bubble and
spike regions of the fluid. \cite{Sadot1998} combined the linear,
impulsive solution with potential flow models of the asymptotic
behavior of the bubble and spike to develop a model for the
perturbation growth that is in good agreement with shock tube
experiments for shocks with Mach numbers Ma=1.3, 3.5. Vortex theory
has also been used to describe the behavior of the
interface. \cite{Jacobs1996} horizontally oscillated a container with
two vertically stratified liquids to obtain standing waves and then
bounced the container off of a coil spring to study the incompressible
\ac{RMI}. The late time evolution of is interface is modeled using a
row of line vorticies to obtain qualitatively similar results to those
experimentally observed, however the late-time growth rate is
underestimated. \cite{Samtaney1994} used shock polar analysis to find
the circulation deposited by a shock on planar and non-planar
interfaces. Their results are validated using and Euler code and found
to be within 10\% of the computed value for $1.0\,<\,$Ma$\,\leq\,1.32$
for all $\rho_2/\rho_1\,>\,1$, and
$5.8\,\leq\,\rho_2/\rho_1\,\leq\,32.6$ for all Ma.

Computational and experimental approaches has been used to study the
impact of nonlinear effects on wave-interface problems such as
shock-bubble and shock-droplet interactions. \cite{Haast1987}
experimentally shocked helium and R22-filled bubbles in air, and
showed that transmitted waves overtook one another an merged
downstream as a result of nonlinear gas dynamics. Numerical
simulations simulations of shock-bubble interactions have verified the
timescales and physical features observed in these experiments. These
simulations, in conjunction with nonlinear theory, and have shown that
baroclinic vorticity is generated by the wave-interface interaction,
and dominates the late-time dynamics of the system
\citep{Picone1988,Quirk2006}. \cite{Hawley1989} performed numerical
experiments to demonstrate that a vorticity deposition and evolution
can be used to explain the dynamics of shock-accelerated fluid-fluid
interfaces after early times. We argue that the basic problem setup of
the \ac{RMI}, a mechanical wave impinging upon a fluid-fluid
interface, is physically similar the an acoustic wave interactions
with air-tissue interfaces in the lungs. While the pressure gradients
of acoustic waves are much weaker than those of shock waves,
nonlinearity arises from the strong density discontinuity across the
tissue-air interfaces of the lungs.

The objective of the present study is to provide a detailed
explanation of the physics governing a perturbed water-air interface
driven by a trapezoidal acoustic wave. This separate from previous
research, which has largely looked at constantly-accelerated and
shock-accelerated interfaces. Consequently, there are physically novel
aspects of the present study.  First, acoustic waves, which are
typically thought of as small amplitude are shown to drive
perturbation growth at the interface via baroclinic vorticity. Shock
waves are, by definition, discontinuous and hence their propagation is
a nonlinear process. In contrast, the propagation of acoustic waves in
a homogeneous medium is a linear process. In the present study
nonlinearity occurs as a result of the strong density discontinuity at
the liquid-gas interface. Second, the acoustic wave has a finite
duration. Hence the vorticity is deposited throughout a finite
interaction time, unlike in the case of the \ac{RMI} in which it is
created by an instantaneous acceleration or the \ac{RTI} in which
vorticity results from constant acceleration. Unlike shocks, which
occur over a few molecular mean free paths and interact nearly
instantaneously, acoustic waves occupy a finite space. Hence their
interaction with interfaces occurs over a finite time. And third,
interface deformation that occurs during the acoustic wave-interface
interaction cannot be neglected. Transient interactions between
deforming interfaces and multiple shocks are known to be capable of
affecting the long term growth of the
interface. \cite{HenrydeFrahan2015b} demonstrated that interface
growth could be controlled through transient wave-interface
interactions by simulating shock passage through layered media, as a
result of subsequent interactions between the interfaces and reflected
and transmitted shocks and rarefactions. This work demonstrates that
interface deformations that occur during the interaction with the
acoustic wave can have a strong effect on the final growth of the
interface.

In the remainder of this work we will first present a model problem
and a set of numerical experiments designed to investigate the
fundamental physics underlying interactions between acoustic waves and
perturbed interfaces between fluids. We will present results that
specifically explore the dependence of the interface dynamics on
acoustically relevant properties including the amplitude and
wavelength of the acoustic wave. We pay particular attention to the
finite duration of the wave-interface interaction, and the interface
deformation that occurs during this period. We perform analysis to
explain the vorticity deposition and late time behavior of the
interface after all acoustic waves have passed. The results will be
discussed to address the following questions:

We will then discuss on the significance of these results as
they regard to the motivating problem of \ac{DUS}-induced lung
hemorrhage. We will finally end by summarizing the main conclusions
drawn from this work and suggest the next steps to be taken.

\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}%
\subsection{Physical problem of interest}
\label{subsec:physical_problem}
Consider a \ac{DUS} pulse as it travels into the lungs. The wave
traverses several layers of soft tissue and fluid that make up the
thoracic wall and pulmonary pleura. After passing through the pleurae,
the wave encounters a network of openly connected, air-filled saccules
with distinctly irregular surfaces. These are the alveoli. It is the
interaction between an incident \ac{US} pulse and the first alveolar
tissue-air interface it encounters, as illustrated in figure
\ref{fig:alveolar_schematic}\hl{MAKE A BETTER FIGURE}, to which we
focus our attention. For simplicity, we will model this problem using
acoustic wave traveling from soft tissue (treated as water) onto an
alveolus (treated as air). As we are motivated to study
\ac{DUS}-induced \ac{LH}, we will use the physical conditions relevant
to this problem to lend context to our study, though we will expand
the range of parameters we study to gain further insight study
acoustically driven interfaces.

There are several length and time scales relevant to this
problem. The reference length scale that we will use throughout the
rest of this work is the mean alveolar diameter $\ell$, which for
adult humans is about $\approx 200 \mu$m \citep{Ochs2004}. The
thoracic wall has mean anterior thickness ranging from $2.1$ - $2.3$
cm \cite{McLean2011}, such that the length of the fluid layer in front
of the alveolus $>>\ell$. The focal diameter of the ultrasound is at
minimum of the order of the ultrasonic wave $\lambda$, which is
$\approx 1$ mm for $1.5$ MHz \ac{US}, which has been found to cause
\ac{LH} in mice and rats \cite{Child1990,Miller2015a}. As this focal diameter is
appreciably larger than $\ell$, a flat alveolar interface will see the
incoming pulse as a spatially uniform plane wave. We will consider an
ultrasound pulse duration of approximately $5.5 \mu$s, which is
consistent with previous research \citep{Child1990}, and has a
corresponding spatial duration of $L=45\ell = 9$mm for a soft tissue sound
speed of $c=1649$ m/s. 

The lungs have long been recognized highly inhomogeneous, viscoelastic
organs \citep{Bayliss1939,Suki1994} with multiple physical effects at
play, including viscosity, elasticity, and surface tension. We perform
dimensional analyses to determine which of these are important over
the length and time scales relevant to the dynamics during
\ac{DUS}. In consideration of viscous effects, we calculate an
approximate length scale over which viscous effects will travel in the
tissue. To avoid the effects of multiple \ac{US} pulses, the longest
time span reasonable to observe the evolution of the system of is the
time between consecutive pulses, which for a typical pulse repetition
frequency of $1$ kHz is $t<\delta t_{pulse}=1000 \mu$ s. Due to
computational limitations, this work only considers the evolution of
the system up to $t\leq1000 \ell/c_{air}=576 \mu$s, such that the
viscous length will scale as
$L_{viscous}\sim\sqrt{\nu_{water} \delta t_{pulse}}=20 \mu$m. This is
appreciably less that $\ell$, and as we will demonstrate later,
appreciably less than some of the deformations we observe. Hence will
exclude the effects of viscosity in our calculations. In consideration
of surface tension in the lung, and which has been measured as $9$ mN/m
\citep{Schurch1976}, we define an acoustic Weber number for a
$p_a=1$ MPa acoustic wave amplitude such that
$We=p_a\ell/\sigma_{lung}=\orderof{10^4}>>1$, suggesting that the
acoustic forces during \ac{DUS} are far greater than those generated
by surface tension and as such we will neglect surface tension in our
model. Lastly, in consideration of the elasticity of the alveolar
wall, treated as $K = 5$ kPa \cite{Cavalcante2005}, we compute an
acoustic Cauchy number such that $Ca=p_a/K=200$, such that we neglect
the effects of elasticity in the lungs.

% \end{figure}
% 
Based on the described problem of interest as illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:alveolar_schematic} and our previous considerations the
relevant physical mechanisms, we view the problem as an inviscid,
compressible fluid system. Hence we will solve the Euler Equations of
fluid motion, as described later in section
\ref{subsec:governing_equations}, and must define an appropriate
initial condition to model the problem. Thus we consider a 2D,
rectangular fluid domain in the $xy$-plane such that
$0\leq x\leq 1\ell$ and $-20\ell\leq y\leq 60\ell$. Soft tissue and
fluid surrounding the lung (modeled as water) sit atop an alveolus
(modeled as air). An acoustic wave impinges from the water downward
$(-\bs{\hat{e}}_y)$ toward the air. A schematic of the model problem
is shown in \ref{fig:problem_schematic}.

To captures the surface roughness of the alveolus, we prescribe the
initial interface to include a single-mode sinusoidal perturbation of
amplitude $a_0$ such that the vertical center of the interface is
described by
\begin{align} %Not y_interface in the code
  Y(x,t=0)_{interface} = a_0\sin\left(\frac{2\pi x}{\ell}-\frac{\pi}{2}\right),
\end{align}
hereafter referred to as $Y_{0,interface}$. For this study
$a_0=0.03\ell$ is used as a base value, though we explore the effects
of this amplitude for cases of $a_0=0.1\ell, 0.2\ell\ 0.3\ell$ where
specified. This interface geometry is consistent previous studies of
the \ac{RMI} \citep{Brouillette2002}. An interface thickness
$\delta=0.08\ell$ is prescribed such that above
$y\geq Y_{0,interface}+\delta/2$ the fluid is pure water, below
$y\leq Y_{0,interface}-\delta/2$ is pure air. In the region
$Y_{0,interface}-\delta/2 < y < Y_{0,interface}+\delta/2$, the fluid
consists of an air-water mixture, the specific treatment of which is
described later in section \ref{subsec:governing_equations}.

While our motivation is rooted in ac{DUS} of the lung, a typical
\ac{DUS} pulse is mathematically complicated and not ideal for
understanding the fundamental physics of acoustically-driven perturbed
liquid-air interfaces. Hence, we must build a simpler acoustic
waveform. To do this, we consider the differences between a \ac{DUS}
acoustic pulse and a shock, the most well studied wave for this type
of problem. We seek to create an acoustic waveform that interaction
with the interface can be partially explained studied using previously
established principles for shock-driven interfaces. We identify three
key conditions that are met by an acoustic pulse that are not met by a
shock. 1) Although sometimes highly nonlinear, \ac{DUS} pulse waves
are continuous, unlike shock waves. 2) Acoustic waves interact with
the interface over a finite time span, whereas shocks are typically
treated as accelerating the interface instantaneously. 3) Acoustic
waves contain a finite perturbation, eventually returning a
homogeneous medium approximately to its undisturbed state after
passing. Previous \ac{RMI} studies have typically considered shock
waves that leave the post-shock region in a state of elevated
pressure, velocity, etc... 

To build our waveform we start from a shock wave and adjust to meet
the three listed conditions. To uphold continuity within the wave, we
allow the acoustic pressure to increase linearly to a maximum
amplitude $p_a$ over a fixed region, $\Delta L_a$. As we are
interested in baroclinic vorticity, we choose $\Delta L_a$ such that
the acoustic pressure gradient is $\nabla p=p_a/\Delta L_a$ is roughly
consistent with that of \ac{DUS}. We assume that acoustic pressure
changes occur over a physical length on the order of the acoustic
wavelength $\lambda\approx 1$ for a $1.5$ MHz pulse. Thus for an
alveolus of diameter $200 \mu$ m, the expected pressure gradient is
$\nabla p=p_a/\lambda/2=p_a/5\ell$. Hence $\Delta L_a=5\ell$. To meet
the third condition, we eventually let the acoustically perturbed
quantities, $p, v, \rho$ fall over a length $\Delta L_a=5\ell$. To
meet the second condition we seek to have our wave interact with the
interface for a typical \ac{DUS} pulse duration, which we previously
established to have a corresponding spacial length of $45\ell$. Thus
we arrive at an initial condition for our a acoustic waveform as a
trapezoidal wave that rises in pressure from $p_{atm}$ to $p_a$ over a
length $5\ell$ remains static over a length of $35\ell$ and then drops
back to $p_{atm}$ over a final $5\ell$. This process by which we
arrived at this waveform and the final waveform itself is illustrated
in Figure \ref{fig:p0}. In choosing appropriate $p_a$ values for the
numerical experiments performed in this study, we do not limit
ourselves to strictly to acoustic parameters relevant to \ac{DUS} and
we will consider values of $p_a$ including $1, 5, 7.5, 10,$ and $15$
MPa. Unless otherwise stated, $p_a=10$ MPa for the results provided.

    wave for the wave-interface interaction is of finite
    duration. Figure \protect\subref{fig:p0_vs_y} shows an example

\subsection{Governing equations}
\label{subsec:governing_equations}
The governing equations describing the motivating problem of \ac{DUS}
of the lung are conservation of mass, momentum, and energy for a
compressible, viscoelastic material. The present work neglects elastic
and viscous effects. Thus we solve the Euler equations are presented
here for the case of fluid motion in two dimensions ($x,y$):
% 
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:euler}%
  \begin{align}% 
    \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u\right)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho v\right)}{\partial y} = 0,\\
    \frac{\partial \rho u}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \rho u^2+p\right)  + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( \rho uv\right) = 0,\\
    \frac{\partial \rho v}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \rho uv\right)  + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( \rho v^2+p\right) = 0,\\
    \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[u\left(E+p\right)\right] + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[v\left(E+p\right)\right] = 0,
  \end{align}%
\end{subequations}%
% 
where $t$ is time, $\rho$ is density, $p$ is the pressure, $u$ and $v$
are the velocity components in the $x$ and $y$ directions
respectively, and $E$ is the total energy. To close the system, we
use a stiffened equation of state to relate the total energy to the
pressure and velocity in the flow, such that,
% 
\begin{align} \label{eq:stiffened_eos}%
  E=\frac{\rho\left(u^2+v^2\right)}{2} + \frac{p+n B}{n-1}.
\end{align}
% 
Here $B$ is a measure of liquid stiffness that has been experimentally
determined for this equation. For perfect gases, such as is our
treatment of air, $n$ is the specific heats ratio and $B=0$. The
sound speed in our simulations is calculated based on the following
relationship, derived from the stiffened equation of state.
% 
\begin{align} \label{eq:sound_speed}%
  c = \sqrt{\frac{n\left(p+B\right)}{\rho}}.
\end{align}
% 
While physical diffusion is not considered in this setup, portions of
the flow contain a water-air mixture as a result of the initial
treatment of the interface and numerical diffusion. The numerical
treatment of the diffusion layer at the interface for the initial
condition is such that the density has an exponential profile
\citep{Latini2007}, which is used to get the mass fraction and
molecular weight fields in the mixed region. These are then used to
determine the initial conditions for $n$ and $B$ in a
thermodynamically consistent fashion.

To solve for the material parameters in the mixed region and prevent
spurious pressure oscillations at the interface, two additional
advection equations are solved for $n$ and $B$.
\begin{subequations} \label{usbe_lung_eosvar_advection}%
  \begin{align}% 
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{n B}{n-1}\right)+u\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{n B}{n-1}\right)+v\frac{\partial}{\partial }\left(\frac{n B}{n-1}\right) = 0,\\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{1}{n-1}\right)+u\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{1}{n-1}\right)+v\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{1}{n-1}\right) = 0. 
  \end{align}%
\end{subequations}%
This implementation is consistent with the works of \cite{Abgrall1996,
  Shyue2001, Beig2015}. Details of the full numerical implementation
are explained by \cite{HenrydeFrahan2015}.
%
\subsection{Computational  methods}%

Before solving the system of governing equations presented we
non-dimensionalize by the density and sound speed of air (provided
below). It is worth noting that the Euler equations are length scale
invariant, and thus no inherent physical length scale exists in the
equations that we solve. Hence reason that all length scales are
defined in terms of the to the alveolar length scale $\ell$, which is
also the initial interface perturbation wavelength and the width of
the computational domain.

The dimensional fluid properties used for air determined at a
temperature of $300$ K and an $1$ atm of pressure such that
$\rho^*_{air}=1.18$ (kg/m$^3$). The stiffened equation of state
variables are given by $n_{air}=1.4$ and $B^*_{air} = 0$ (Pa) such
that $c^*_{air}=347.2$ (m/s) based on equation
\eqref{eq:sound_speed}. For water, $\rho^*_{water}=996$ (kg/m$^3$) and
the stiffened equation of state variables have been determined
empirically and are given by $n_{water}=5.5$ and
$B^*_{water} = 492115000$ (Pa) such that $c^*_{water}=1648.7$ (m/s)
\citep{Marsh1980,holian1984t,Cocchi1996}. Non-dimensionalizing these
values based on the density and sound speed of air presented we find
that $\rho_{air}=1$, $B_{air} = 0$, $c_{air}=1$, and
$\rho_{water}=846.6$, $B_{water} = 3469.1$, and $c_{water}=4.75$.
 
To solve the governing equations, we implement a third-order accurate
\ac{DG} scheme in space and a fourth-order accurate, adaptive
Runge-Kutta method to march forward in time
\citep{HenrydeFrahan2015}. Roe solver is used to calculate flux in and
out of each cell in a way that handles discontinuities and keeps the
interface sharp. The grid resolution is 100 points per $\ell$ unless
otherwise stated. To minimize artificial reflections, we use inflow
and outflow boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the domain,
and implement geometric grid stretching in the vertical direction for
the top and bottom-most $10\ell$ segments of the grid. Periodic
boundary conditions are used at the left and right edges of the
domain.

\subsection{Qualitative observations of the interface response to the trapezoidal wave}
\label{subsec:Qualitative}
To provide a qualitative understanding of the physics underlying the
wave-interface interaction, we consider a base reference case in which
a $p_a=10$ MPa trapezoidal wave, of length $L=45\ell$, (See Figure
\ref{fig:p0}) impinges from water onto the water-air interface. Nearly
all of the acoustic energy is reflected back into the water as a
tension wave due to the sharp decrease in acoustic impedance across
the interface. The transmitted compression wave is weakly focused due
to the sound speed mismatch across the curved interface
perturbation. The reflected and transmitted waves dissipate at the
inflow and outflow boundaries.

Figure \ref{fig:interface_snapshots} illustrates the evolution of the interface. Contour plots of the density
during the compression-interface interaction $(t=1)$, shortly after
the wave leaves the interface $(t=10)$, and at late times
$(t=100, 300)$ are shown. Note that all times and lengths presented are
dimensionless such that $t = \text{Time}/(\ell/c_{air}$ and $x$,

water) are indicated in dark blue. Low-density regions (i.e., air) are
indicated in light-blue. Isocontours of volume fraction of water
$\alpha=0.5$ are indicated in black. The interface
perturbation grows from an initially smooth sinusoid to a sharp point
at late times, long after all waves have left the domain.

% 
To more closely exam the interface dynamics in the period surrounding
the wave-interface interaction, Figure \ref{fig:trapz10_interface25}
shows the interface perturbation amplitude nondimensionalized by its
initial value $a(t)/a_0$ for $t\leq25$, the period during and shortly
after the wave-interface interaction. We have labeled the times at
which different portions of the incoming wave encounter the interface
as $t_{1-4}$, denoted with black $\bs{\times}$s along the curves in
these figures and those hereafter. From $t_1=0^+$ to $t_2\approx1.1$
the compression wave encounters the interface. At $t_2$, the incoming
pressure reaches its maximum amplitude, $p_a=10$ MPa, and remains
constant until $t_3\approx8.5$. During this period, the interface
amplitude continues to decrease until $t\approx 5.0$, at which point
the perturbation undergoes a phase inversion and begins to grow. This
phase inversion is similar to that observed for the heavy-light
interface Richtmyer-Meshkov problem. At $t_3$ the pressure expansion
hits the interface and the perturbation amplitude continues to
grow. At $t_4\approx9.7$ the acoustic wave has finished traversing the
interface, and the interface pressure is nominally atmospheric. Figure
\ref{fig:trapz10_interface1000} shows $a(t)/a_0$ for $t\leq1000$. The
interface amplitude continues to grow indefinitely, long after all
acoustic waves have left the domain and the pressure field has
returned to atmospheric. In the absence of viscosity or other loss
mechanisms, this is expected. At late times, vorticity remains to
drive the deformation of the interface.

\subsection{Vorticity and circulation dynamics}

    indicated in blue. Constant volume fraction of water $\alpha=0.5$
    contour lines are indicated in black. As this plot is designed
    only to illustrate the location of vorticity, the color scale
    changes at each time and its values are not indicated here.}
  \label{fig:vorticity_snapshots}
\end{figure}
% 
To explain the continued growth of the interface at late times, we
look to vorticity. Figure \ref{fig:vorticity_snapshots} shows
contour plots of the vorticity field at $t=1, 10, 100, 300$, for the
$10$ MPa trapezoidal wave case. Areas of positive (counter-clockwise)
vorticity are indicated in red. Areas of negative (clockwise)
vorticity are indicated in blue. As the purpose of this plot is to
visualize the location of vorticity, the color scale changes at each
time step and is not indicated on this plot. The position of the
interface is indicated by black contour lines of constant volume
fraction of water $\alpha=0.5$. At $t=1$, near the end of the
compression-interface interaction, the bulk of the vorticity is in
air-dominated fluid. As the perturbation grows, vorticity bleeds
across the interface. Vorticity remains concentrated around the middle
of the interface and in its wake.

To better understand the vorticity dynamics we consider the vorticity
generation equation for a 2D, inviscid fluid system,
\begin{align} \label{eq:vorticity_euler}
  \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\omega}}{\partial t}+\left(\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\right)\boldsymbol{\omega} =% 
  - \boldsymbol{\omega}\left(\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}\right) + \frac{\nabla\rho\times\nabla p}{\rho^2}.%
\end{align}

Each term in equation \eqref{eq:vorticity_euler} represents a
different physical mechanism by which the vorticity
$\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is changing. Terms on the left-hand side
represent changes in the existing vorticity field and terms on the
right represent vorticity sources and sinks. On the left, the first
term represents the total change of vorticity at a location in the
flow field with respect to time and the second term represents the
advection of vorticity. On the right, the first term describes changes
in vorticity due to compressibility, and the second term is the
baroclinic term which describes vorticity generated by the
misalignment of the pressure and density gradients. We
seek to understand the relative importance of these mechanisms on the
dynamics of the acoustically accelerated interface.

\subsubsection{Order of magnitude analysis of vorticity generation mechanisms}
\label{subsubsec:oom_analysis}
To quantifiably compare the various mechanisms by which vorticity
changes within the flow we perform an order of magnitude analysis on
each term of the vorticity generation equation
\eqref{eq:vorticity_euler}.

To determine the appropriate time and location for the analysis, we
recognize that the flow is initially free of vorticity and any
vorticity generated must be a result of acoustic energy being
converted to kinetic energy in the flow. The only mechanism for
this to occur in an inviscid fluid without pre-existing vorticity is
baroclinicity. Thus we require misaligned density and pressure
gradients. The greatest density gradients in the flow occur across the
interface. The strongest pressure gradients occur in the acoustic
wave. Hence we choose to perform our analysis at the water-air
interface during the wave-interface interaction.

For simplicity, we consider specifically the time in which the
compression interacts with the interface. This interaction occurs
quickly, over approximately $\Delta t_a\approx5\ell/c_{w}$. As such we
treat the interface as static and undeformed during this
interaction. Based on the results presented in Figure
\ref{fig:trapz10_interface}, the average perturbation amplitude during
this period is $<a(t_{1-2})>\approx0.96\ a_0$, suggesting that this
assumption is reasonable for order of magnitude analysis.

To evaluate the order of magnitude of the individual terms of the
vorticity generation equation \eqref{eq:vorticity_euler}, we treat
gradient, curl, and divergence of any arbitrary quantity $f$ such that
$\abs{\nabla} f= \orderof{\left|\Delta f\right|/\Delta L}$,
$\nabla\cdot f=\orderof{\left|\Delta f\right|/\Delta L}$, and
$\nabla\times f=\orderof{\left|\Delta f\right|/\Delta L}$. Here
$\Delta f$ is a change in $f$ over a characteristic length scale
$\Delta L$. As the only motion in the flow is generated by the
acoustic wave, we consider acoustic pressure, velocity, and density
perturbations such that $\Delta p=\Delta p_a$,
$\Delta \boldsymbol{u}=\Delta \boldsymbol{u}_a$, and
$\Delta \rho=\Delta \rho_a$. The subscript $_a$ denotes acoustic
quantities. We use acoustic relations to relate these quantities
\citep{Anderson1990},
\begin{align}%
  \label{eq:acoustic_relations}%
  \Delta p_a=\pm\Delta u_a \rho c=c^2\Delta \rho_a.%
\end{align}

To assess the baroclinic contribution to vorticity, we write the cross
product of the density and pressure gradients as
$\abs{\nabla \rho} \abs{\nabla p} \sin{\left(\theta\right)}$. Here
$\theta$ is the angle between the acoustic pressure gradient, treated
as being in the $\plus y$-direction, and the direction of the density
gradient which we treat as the outward normal direction to the
interface. For $a_0/\ell<<1$, we can approximate
$\sin{\left(\theta\right)}\approx\theta$ at the interface. The density
gradient due to the water-air interface is far greater than that due
to the acoustic wave. As such we use the change in density across the
interface $\Delta \rho_I$ and associated length scale $\Delta L_I$ to
write the density gradient. The pressure change is a result of the
acoustic wave, and as such we use the acoustic pressure change
$\Delta p_a$ and associated length scale $\Delta L_a$ to express the
pressure gradient. And thus we write the order of magnitude of the
baroclinic vorticity generation term at the interface,
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:baroclinic_vorticity}%
  \norm{\frac{\nabla\rho\times\nabla p}{\rho^2}} =%
  \orderof{\frac{\abs{\Delta \rho_I}}{\abs{\Delta L_I}}\frac{\abs{\Delta p_a}}{\abs{\Delta L_a}}\frac{1}{\abs{\rho}^2}\abs{\theta}}.%
\end{align}

In the evaluation of the compressible and advective terms we consider
two possible evaluations of the vorticity $\omega$ as either the curl
of the acoustic velocity field
$\boldsymbol{\omega}=\nabla\times\boldsymbol{u}$ or the integral of
the baroclinic vorticity generation term from
\eqref{eq:baroclinic_vorticity}, treated as constant, over the
characteristic time of the pressure rise
$\Delta t_a\approx\Delta L_a/c_w$. Evaluating the vorticity using both
of these expressions and the values presented later in this section
reveals that the baroclinic expression of the vorticity is dominant
for the regimes of interest to this study and is thus what we will use
this treatment in our further analysis. Hence the approximate order of magnitude of the compressible and
advective vorticity generation is written as
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:compressible_advective_vorticity}%
  \norm{-\boldsymbol{\omega}\left(\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}\right)}\sim \norm{\left(\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\right)\boldsymbol{\omega}} = %
  \orderof{%
  \frac{\abs{\Delta u_a}}{\abs{\Delta L_a}} \frac{\abs{\Delta \rho_I}}{\abs{\Delta L_I}}%
  \frac{\abs{\Delta p_a}}{\abs{\Delta L_a}} \frac{1}{\abs{\rho}^2}\abs{\theta}\frac{\abs{c}}{\abs{\Delta L_a}}%
  }.%
\end{align}

Now, to compare the relative importance of the baroclinic and
compressible (or advective) contributions to vorticity we will look at
the ratio of the two vorticity generation approximations. We divide
equation \eqref{eq:baroclinic_vorticity} by equation
\eqref{eq:compressible_advective_vorticity} using
\eqref{eq:acoustic_relations} to express acoustic quantities in terms
of the acoustic perturbation quantities $\Delta \rho_a,\,\Delta u_a$ and simplify,
\begin{align} \label{eq:vorticity_comparison}
  \frac{\norm{\frac{\nabla\rho\times\nabla
  p}{\rho^2}}}{\norm{-\boldsymbol{\omega}\left(\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}\right)}}
  \sim
  \frac{\norm{\frac{\nabla\rho\times\nabla
  p}{\rho^2}}}{\norm{\left(\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\right)\boldsymbol{\omega}}}
  = \orderof{\frac{\abs{c}}{\abs{\Delta u_a}}} = \orderof{\frac{\abs{\rho}}{\abs{\Delta \rho_a}}}%
\end{align}

To evaluate the above expressions for comparison with our
computational results, we consider our base trapezoidal wave case
where $p_a = \Delta p_a = 10$ MPa. The length scale associated with
the acoustic wave is the initial length of the pressure rise
$\Delta L_a=5\ell$. The initial interface length scale
$\Delta L_I$, defined as the thickness of the thickness of the mixed
layer from $\alpha=0.05$ to $0.95$ volume fraction of water is estimated
as $\Delta L_I \approx 0.05\ell$. We approximate the order of theta
based on its average value along a half-wavelength of the interface
for $a_0=0.03\ell$ such that
$<\abs{\theta}>\approx0.12$. Evaluating expression
\eqref{eq:vorticity_comparison} we to find that
$\abs{c}/\abs{\Delta u_a}$=247 and thus expect that the relative
contribution of baroclinic to compressible/advective vorticity
generation is approximately of order $\orderof{10^2}$ at
$t=\Delta t_a=1.05$.

To compare our computational results to the analysis we consider the
integral of the vorticity and vorticity generation terms over the
right-half domain,
\begin{align}
  \Gamma = \int_{A_{RH}} \omega \,dA_{RH},
\end{align}
where
$\int_{A_{RH}} dA_{RH} =
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\int_{\ell/2}^{\ell} \,dy\, dx$. Note
that the right-half domain is considered because the total circulation
over the whole domain is $0$ due to symmetry. Circulation is chosen as
the quantity of comparison as it is a global quantity, which better
captures the overall vorticity dynamics than the vorticity at any
single point. As a single quantity rather than a field, it is also
simpler to compare the computational and analytical results. The
relative order of magnitude relationships obtained in
\eqref{eq:vorticity_comparison} are spatially independent and expected
to hold when integrated over the right-half domain. Accordingly we
evaluate the vorticity generation terms from our computational results
integrated over the right-half domain. At $t=1.0$ we find that %
$$ \int_{A_{RH}} \left[\frac{\nabla\rho\times\nabla p}{\rho^2}\right] / \left[\left(\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\right)\boldsymbol{\omega}\right]\,\,dA_{RH}\approx 285=\orderof{10^2}$$
and
$$ \int_{A_{RH}} \left[\frac{\nabla\rho\times\nabla p}{\rho^2}\right] / \left[-\boldsymbol{\omega}\left(\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}\right)\right]\,\,dA_{RH} \approx 145=\orderof{10^2}.$$%
% %
% \begin{comment} %This shows actual values instead of relative ones
% $ \int_{A_{RH}} \left(\frac{\nabla\rho\times\nabla p}{\rho^2}\right)
% \,\,dA_{RH}= 7.7\,\text{e}{-3}$, %
% $ \int_{A_{RH}} \left(\boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\right)\boldsymbol{\omega}\,\,dA_{RH}
% = -5.3\text{e}{-5}$, and %
% $ \int_{A_{RH}}
% -\boldsymbol{\omega}\left(\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}\right)\,\,dA_{RH} =
% 2.7\text{e}{-5}$.%
% \end{comment}
%
Hence the computational results and analysis are in agreement and suggest
that the vorticity is nearly entirely baroclinic.

\subsubsection{Circulation deposition}
Having established that the circulation is a primarily result of
baroclinic vorticity, we now look to understand the circulation
deposition associated with the wave-interface interaction period.

\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:trapz10_circ_schematic}, shows circulation history of
the right-half domain for the $10$ MPa wave case for $t\leq25$, during
and shortly after the wave-interface interaction, and for the duration
of the simulation, $t\leq1000$. The points at which the different
components of the wave encounter the interface are indicate as
$t_{1-4}$, as described in section \ref{subsec:Qualitative}.

From $t_1=0^+$ to $t_2$ the compression wave encounters the interface
and $\Gamma$ increases. From $t_2\approx1.1$ to $t_3\approx8.5$ the
pressure gradient at the interface is small and $\Gamma$ changes
little. From Figure \ref{fig:trapz10_interface}, the perturbation
undergoes a phase inversion at $t\approx 5.0$, and hence the density
gradient along the interface reverses direction around this point in
time. At $t_3\approx8.5$ the expansion wave first hits the
interface. The pressure and density gradients at the interface have
both reversed sign since the initial compression wave-interface
interaction and $\Gamma$ increases sharply again. At
$t_4\approx9.7$ the acoustic wave has finished traversing the
interface and ceases depositing vorticity around the interface.

    collapse the curves, the interface amplitude has been scaled by
    the circulation divided by the length of the interface at

    motion of the interface begin to dominate the effects of the
    wave itself.}
  \label{fig:trapz_interface_loglog}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:trapz_interface_loglog} shows the interface
amplitude histories for $5$ (blue), $7.5$ (red), and $10$ (green) MPa
trapezoidal wave cases for $0 \leq t\leq 1000$ plotted on a
logarithmic scale. The perturbation amplitude history is plotted on
logarithmically-scaled axes such that the constant slope at late times
suggests power law growth. To collapse the data, we perform
dimensional analysis. For a purely-circulation-driven interface
perturbation, we would expect the growth of the interface $a(t)/a_0$
to depend on the total circulation $\Gamma$ and the area over which it
is distributed, which in our case goes with the interface length $s$. Thus
% 
\begin{align} \label{eq:intf_circ_scaling}
  \frac{a(t)}{a_0} \sim \left(\frac{\Gamma t}{s}\right)^n,
\end{align}
% 
Where the exponent $n$ is a constant that has been empirically
determined to be approximately $\frac{3}{5}$. As we expect this
analysis to be valid during the regime in which circulation dominates
the interface dynamics, we seek to evaluate $\Gamma$ and $s$ at the
instant in time in which the circulation becomes the dominant
mechanism driving the motion of the interface. Initially after the
wave encounters the interface, there is little vorticity and entire
interface is accelerated downward by the increased acoustic pressure
in the water. As the acoustic pressure drops and vorticity around the
interface remains or increases, at some time $t_\Gamma$, the
circulation begins to dominate the motion of the interface. This is
observed to occur when the accelerate the entire interface downward,
and peaks and troughs of the interface, driven by vortex pairs of
opposite sign, begin to move in opposite directions. Specifically, for
our cases the positive acoustic pressure in the water drives the
entire interface downward, in the $-y$-direction, until at
$t_\Gamma\approx9.4$ the vorticity overcomes the decreasing acoustic
pressure in the water and the $y-$velocity at the interface peaks
becomes positive. We expect that by evaluating $\Gamma$ and $s$ at
$t_\Gamma$ the interface growth curves will collapse. This is
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:trapz_interface_t1000_scaled}. The
interface phase inversion has been synced to occur simultaneously to
better illustrate the collapse of the data at early times.

To better understand the distribution of vorticity generation within
the gas-liquid mixture region of the interface we perform an order of
magnitude analysis to compare the baroclinic vorticity from equation
\eqref{eq:baroclinic_vorticity} in pure water vs air. As this can
already be evaluated in water from what we have provided up to this
point, we will focus on evaluation of the order of baroclinic
vorticity generation in air.

Throughout this analysis we will denote the properties of the incoming
wave and water with a subscript $-$, and the transmitted wave and air
with a subscript $+$. For water, we will use the values for
$\Delta \rho_I, \Delta L_I, \Delta \rho_a, \Delta L_a$ and $\theta$
previously defined in the section \ref{subsubsec:oom_analysis}, based
on our initial condition. Our treatment of the density gradient across
the interface will remain unchanged for evaluation in air such that
$\Delta \rho_I^-=\Delta \rho_I^+$ and $\Delta L_I^-=\Delta L_I^+$. To
evaluate the remaining terms in air we will borrow techniques from
linear acoustics. To find the pressure rise in the transmitted wave
$\Delta p_a^+$, we recognize that $a_0/\ell<<1$ and treat the
incoming wave as a plane wave impinging normally on a flat material
interface such that $\Delta p_a^+=\bs{T} \Delta p_a^-$, where $\bs{T}$
is the acoustic transmission coefficient,
$\bs{T}=2\rho^+ c^+/\left(\rho^+ c^+ + \rho^- c^- \right)$
\citep{Kinsler1982}. For our water-air interface
$\bs{T}\approx4.97\times10^{-4}$. Because of the strong impedance
mismatch between fluids, the acoustic wave is almost entirely
reflected, decreasing the pressure gradient in the air. Because of the
drop in sound speed across the interface, the transmitted wave is
compressed into a smaller physical area (i.e., the wavelength
decreases) relative to the incoming wave, such that
$\Delta L_a^+=\Delta L_a^- (c^+/c^-)$. This effect increases the
pressure gradient in the air. To evaluate $\theta^+$, we utilize
Snell's law which states that
$c^-\sin{\theta^-}=c^+\sin{\theta^+}$. Because $a_0/\ell<<1$ it is
also true that $\theta^-<<1$, thus we use the small angle
approximation of $\sin$ to find that
$\theta^+\approx\theta^-(c^+/c^-)$. This refraction effect decreases
the misalignment between the pressure and density gradients for the
transmitted wave relative to the incoming wave. Quantitatively it also
approximately cancels the increase in vorticity deposition that arises
as a result of the increased pressure gradient created by the decrease
in the length of the transmitted wave.

To get an idea of where within the mixed gas-liquid region at the
interface the vorticity will be generated, we consider equation
\eqref{eq:baroclinic_vorticity} in air and water and write the ratio
to find
\begin{align}%
  \label{eq:baroclinic_air_water}%
  % \left(\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial t}\right)_{\substack{\text{baroclinic}\\\text{air}}} / \left(\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial t}\right)_{\substack{\text{baroclinic}\\\text{water}}}%
  \frac{\norm{\frac{\nabla\rho\times\nabla p}{\rho^2}}_{air\quad}}{\norm{\frac{\nabla\rho\times\nabla p}{\rho^2}}_{water}}
  =&\orderof{\frac{\left[\frac{\abs{\Delta \rho_I^+}}{\abs{\Delta L_I^+}}\frac{\abs{\Delta p_a^+}}{\abs{\Delta L_a^+}}\frac{1}{\abs{\rho^+}^2}\abs{\theta^+}\right]}
     {\left[\frac{\abs{\Delta \rho_I^+}}{\abs{\Delta L_I^+}}\frac{\left(\abs{\Delta p_a^+}/\abs{\bs{T}}\right)}{\abs{\Delta L_a^+}\left(\abs{c^+}/\abs{c^-}\right)}\frac{1}{\abs{\rho^-}^2}\left(\abs{c^+}/\abs{c^-}\right)\abs{\theta^+}\right]}},\nonumber\\%
  =&\orderof{\abs{\bs{T}}\left(\frac{\abs{\rho^-}}{\abs{\rho^+}}\right)^2}.%
\end{align}
For our water-air interface, we evaluate equation
\eqref{eq:baroclinic_air_water} to find that the ratio of baroclinic
vorticity generation in air to that in water would be of order
$\orderof{10^2}$. While this analysis considers vorticity generation
in pure air and water, as opposed to the mixed fluid region that is
exactly relevant to this work, we make two observations based on this
result. First, this result analysis is for an extreme case in which
all of the vortical energy relevant to this problem, is able to be
concentrated in pure air and water, and thus this result acts as an
upper bound on the change in vorticity deposition we expect as the
wave move from water across the interface into air. Additionally, this
result suggests that for the mixed water-air region, where the
strongest density gradient exists, vorticity generation is likely to
occur in gas dominated fluid regions with a higher volume fraction of
air than water.

  \label{fig:baroclinic_y0_distribution}  
\end{figure}

From the vorticity contours at $t=1.0$ shown in
\ref{fig:vorticity_snapshots}, the vorticity is clearly concentrated
in the region with volume fraction of water $\alpha<0.5$. To quantify
this, numerically integrating the vorticity over the right-half domain
we find that 97\% of the circulation occurs in this region. To further
illustrate the dependence of the vorticity deposition on the relative
gas-liquid composition of the fluid within the interface region,
Figure \ref{fig:baroclinic_y0_distribution} shows a scatter plot of
the vorticity values in each cell vs the mean volume fraction of water
in the cell $<\alpha>$ (Left). The average circulation per-cell is
seperated into bins based on the relevant volume fraction to obtain a
histogram and normalized to obtain the circulation distribution
circulation as a function of $\alpha$ (Right). The observed circulation
deposition in air-dominated fluid, $\alpha<0.5$, and is within the
predicted upper bound. This is qualitatively consistent with our
analysis.

  \label{fig:trapz_circ_interface_multi-lag}
\end{figure}
Lastly, we investigate the dependence of the interface and circulation
dynamics on the evolution of the interface that occurs during the
wave-interface interaction. To study this, we vary the duration of the
static elevated pressure that the interface experiences between the
compression and expansion of the trapezoidal wave. For our setup, this
is equivalent to changing initial length of the trapezoidal wave $L$,
while keeping constant the wave amplitude $p_a=10$ MPa and the lengths
of the pressure rise and fall $\Delta L_a$. 

Figure \ref{fig:trapz_circ_interface_multi-lag} shows the interface
amplitude and circulation histories corresponding to waves with
$L=45\ell, 35\ell ,30\ell ,25\ell ,15\ell ,10\ell$
for $t\leq 25$.

For the two longest waves, $L=35\ell, 45\ell$, the expansion
encounters the interface appreciably after the perturbation reverses
phase. In these cases, the expansion deposits additional positive
circulation along the right half of the interface. For the shorter
waves, $L \leq 25\ell$, the expansion encounters the interface
before the perturbation reverses phase and the net half-domain
circulation is decreased. For the $L=30\ell$ case, the expansion
hits the interface very shortly after the interface phase-reversal,
when the interface is nearly flat. As a result of this, the pressure
gradient and density gradient are closely aligned and very little
circulation is generated by the expansion wave.

Comparing cases for which the interface inverts phase before
encountering the expansion, the larger $a(t)$ when the expansion
occurs, the more circulation is generated due to the increases
misalignment in density and pressure gradients. The same is true when
comparing cases for which the interface inverts phase before
encountering the expansion.

After the passage of the acoustic wave and all reflections the
pressure returns to the initial, atmospheric conditions. This implies
that the integral of the pressure gradient $\nabla p$ along the
interface, over all time is zero. If the interface remains unchanged
during the interaction with the wave, as it would for a wave moving
with infinite velocity, $\nabla \rho$ would remain constant and the
net baroclinic circulation deposited must be zero. Thus for any finite
duration acoustic wave to deposit net baroclinic circulation upon an
interface, the interface itself must deform during interaction with
the wave. This deformation alters the misalignment of the pressure and
density gradients throughout the passage of the wave such that
vorticity deposited by the compression and expansion waves do not
cancel. This of particular interest for waves in which the pressure
returns to the initial condition after the wave passes, which is not
the case for the traditional shock-accelerated \ac{RMI} problem.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
This paper demonstrates that acoustic waves may trigger significant
deformation of perturbed liquid-gas interfaces over long periods of
time. The driving mechanism behind this deformation is baroclinic
vorticity, which occurs as a result of misalignment between the
pressure gradient of the acoustic wave and density gradient of the
perturbed interface. To demonstrate this we simulate trapezoidal
acoustic waves of MPa-order amplitude impinging from water onto a
perturbed air interface air.

The work presented here supports the following three conclusions: (1)
Acoustically-generated baroclinic vorticity is capable of
significantly deforming perturbed liquid-gas interfaces. We observed
that much of the vorticity generated by the acoustic wave at the
interface remains with the interface as it evolves and deforms even
long after the passage of all acoustic waves. Part of this is
attributed to a lack of physical mechanism for dissipating vorticity
in the inviscid case considered. From dimensional analysis we find
present present a scaling law for the interface
growth\eqref{eq:intf_circ_scaling}, as a function of the circulation
and interface length at the point when vorticity becomes the dominant
mechanism driving the interface motion. Empirically, from computed
results we find the perturbation amplitude grows as
$t^{\frac{3}{5}}$. 
%
(2) Baroclinic vorticity is predominantly deposited in the gaseous
fluid. We perform analysis to predict that on either side of an
infinitely sharp water-air interface, the vorticity generation rate
would be approximately two orders of magnitude greater on the air side
of the interface than in the water. This is qualitatively supported by
our computational results which find that near the end of the initial
compression wave-interface interaction nearly all of the circulation
exists in fluid dominated by air. For the $10$ MPa wave, for instance,
97\% of the circulation is found in fluid with volume fraction of
water $\alpha<0.5$ at $t=1$, after 91\% of the compression has passed.
%
(3) Changes in the acoustic waveform that have little effect on the
interface dynamics during their interaction can substantially effect
the interface over longer periods of time, via vorticity. By comparing
the effects of $10$ MPa trapezoidal waves with varying static pressure
durations between compression and expansion, we observe that the
evolution of the interface between these two wave components
drastically effects the ultimate growth rate of the interface. The
phase and amplitude of the interface perturbation at the time it
encounters the expansion wave determine the direction and magnitude
respectively of the vorticity deposited. Consequently, the amount of
vorticity remaining at the interface and in the surrounding fluid
after the passage of the wave changes greatly based on the
time-dependent features of the wave. A consequence of this is that it
should be possible to design waves that minimize the growth of the
interface perturbation.

This work is a step toward understanding the effects of acoustically
generated vorticity on gas-liquid interfaces, but there are many
questions left to be answered. Physical effects not considered here
such as viscosity, which is critical to understanding the dissipation
of viscosity, may be important in certain
regimes. Additionally, to fully understand the application of these
findings to the motivating problem of diagnostic induced lung
hemorrhage, it will be pertinent to consider waveforms and geometries
more relevant to the problem.
