\section{Methods} \label{sec:methods}%
In this section, we describe numerical experiments designed to
investigate the fundamental fluid dynamics associated with
acoustically-driven, perturbed liquid-gas interfaces. While the focus
is on the fluid mechanics, we specifically consider acoustic and
geometric properties relevant to the \ac{DUS} of the lung.

\subsection{Problem set-up}

\end{figure}
% 
Figure \ref{fig:problem_schematic} illustrates a close up schematic of
an ultrasound wave impinging upon alveoli (Left) and a schematic view
of the computational problem setup used to model this. We consider a
2D, compressible inviscid fluid system in the $xy$-plane with an
acoustic wave impinging from water (top) downward toward air
(bottom). The water-air interface is initially located at the origin
and has a sinusoidal shape with wavelength $\lambda$ and perturbation
amplitude $0.03\lambda$. The width of the rectangular computational
domain is $\lambda$ such that it is traversed by a single period of
the interface. This interface geometry is consistent previous studies
of the \ac{RMI} \citep{Brouillette2002}.

A typical \ac{DUS} pulse is mathematically complicated and not ideal
for analysis. To simplify the problem, we think of the ultrasound
pulse as a sum of sin waves, each of which is composed of
half-sinusoids, which can be approximated as trapezoidal waves. This
thought process is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:p0}
(Left). Accordingly we use an initially trapezoidal waveform for the
acoustic wave as shown in Figure \ref{fig:p0} (Right). The wave is
composed of three stages, described here in the order that they
encounter the interface. First, compression occurs, the pressure
increases linearly from atmospheric to a maximum of $p_a=1, 5$, or
$10$ MPa gauge pressure. Second, the elevated pressure $p_a$ is held
constant over a fixed period. Note that the subscript $_a$ will be
used from here on to denote properties of the acoustic wave. Third, an
expansion occurs and pressure decreases linearly back to atmospheric
pressure. The pressure rise and fall initially occur over equal
distances $5\lambda$, such that they have constant, equal spatial
slopes $\pm p_{a}/5\lambda$. Unless otherwise stated, the period of
constant pressure has length $35\lambda$ and the total length $L$
of the incoming acoustic wave is $45\lambda$.

    trapezoidal wave was designed was is illustrated. The
    ultrasound pulse is thought of as a sum of sin waves, each of
    which is composed of half-sinusoids, which can be approximated as
    trapezoidal waves (Left). The specific trapezoidal pressure wave prescribed as an
    in initial condition is shown as a function of distance from the
    interface (Right).}%

\subsection{Governing equations}
The governing equations describing the motivating problem of \ac{DUS}
of the lung are conservation of mass, momentum, and energy for a
compressible, viscoelastic material. The present work neglects elastic
and viscous effects. Thus we solve the Euler equations are presented
here for the case of fluid motion in two dimensions ($x,y$):
% 
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:euler}%
  \begin{align}% 
    \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u\right)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho v\right)}{\partial y} = 0,\\
    \frac{\partial \rho u}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \rho u^2+p\right)  + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( \rho uv\right) = 0,\\
    \frac{\partial \rho v}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( \rho uv\right)  + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left( \rho v^2+p\right) = 0,\\
    \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[u\left(E+p\right)\right] + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left[v\left(E+p\right)\right] = 0,
  \end{align}%
\end{subequations}%
% 
where $t$ is time, $\rho$ is density, $p$ is the pressure, $u$ and $v$
are the velocity components in the $x$ and $y$ directions
respectively, and $E$ is the total energy. We use the density and
sound speed of air at 300 K to nondimensionalize the system. It is
worth noting that the Euler equations are length scale invariant, and
thus no inherent physical length scale exists in the equations that we
solve. Hence all length scales hereafter will be considered relative
to an interface perturbation wavelength $\lambda$.

To close the system, we use a stiffened equation of state to
relate the total energy to the pressure and velocity in the flow, such
that,
% 
\begin{align} \label{eq:stiffened_eos}%
  E=\frac{\rho\left(u^2+v^2\right)}{2} + \frac{p+\gamma B}{\gamma-1}.
\end{align}
% 
Here $B$ is a measure of liquid stiffness that has been experimentally
determined for this equation. For perfect gases, such as is our
treatment of air, $\gamma$ is the specific heats ratio and $B=0$. The
sound speed in our simulations is calculated based on the following
relationship, derived from the stiffened equation of state.
% 
\begin{align}
  c = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma\left(p+B\right)}{\rho}}.
\end{align}
% 
While physical diffusion is not considered in this setup, portions of
the flow contain a water-air mixture as a result of the initial
treatment of the interface and numerical diffusion. The numerical
treatment of the diffusion layer at the interface for the initial
condition is such that the density has an exponential profile
\citep{Latini2007}, which is used to get the mass fraction and
molecular weight fields in the mixed region. These are then used to
determine the initial conditions for $\gamma$ and $B$ in a
thermodynamically consistent fashion.

To solve for the material parameters in the mixed region and prevent
spurious pressure oscillations at the interface, two additional
advection equations are solved for $\gamma$ and $B$.
\begin{subequations} \label{usbe_lung_eosvar_advection}%
  \begin{align}% 
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\gamma B}{\gamma-1}\right)+\boldsymbol{u}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\gamma B}{\gamma-1}\right) = 0,\\
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{1}{\gamma-1}\right)+\boldsymbol{u}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{1}{\gamma-1}\right) = 0. 
  \end{align}%
\end{subequations}%
This implementation is consistent with the works of \cite{Abgrall1996,
  Shyue2001, Beig2015}. Details of the full numerical implementation
are explained by \cite{HenrydeFrahan2015}.

The dimensional and dimensionless values of each fluid property can be
found in tables \ref{tab:usbe_lung_dimensional_parameters} and
\ref{tab:usbe_lung_dimensionless_parameters} respectively. Values for
$\gamma$ and $B$ for water have been determined
empirically\citep{Marsh1980,holian1984t,Cocchi1996}.

\subsection{Numerical methods}%
\label{subsec:numerical_methods}%
To solve the governing equations, we implement a third-order accurate
\ac{DG} scheme in space and a fourth-order accurate, adaptive
Runge-Kutta method to march forward in time
\citep{HenrydeFrahan2015}. Roe solver is used to calculate flux in and
out of each cell in a way that handles discontinuities and keeps the
interface sharp. As previously stated, the computational domain width
($x$-direction) is $\lambda$. The domain length ($y$-direction) is
80$\lambda$. The grid resolution is 100 points per $\lambda$ unless
otherwise stated. To minimize artificial reflections, we use inflow
and outflow boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the domain,
and implement geometric grid stretching in the vertical direction for
the top and bottom-most 10$\lambda$ segments of the grid. Periodic
boundary conditions are used at the left and right edges of the
domain.
