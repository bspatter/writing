abstract = {An accurate treatment of material interfaces in compressible multiphase flows poses important challenges for high-resolution numerical methods. Although high-order interface-capturing schemes have been used to accurately simulate gas/liquid interfaces with the Euler equations, these methods can result in temperature spikes at material discontinuities. While this phenomenon is not problematic for Euler simulations, it gives rise to numerical errors when heat conduction is included. In this work, we identify the source of these errors and propose a methodology to prevent their occurrence for various models used to represent gas/liquid interfaces in compressible flows based on a “single-fluid” formulation, in which interfaces are represented by discontinuities in the material properties. Our focus lies in materials (gases and liquids primarily, but also solids) that can be described by a stiffened equation of state, though our approach is generalizable to other equations. We show that numerical approaches that prevent pressure oscillations at interfaces may generate temperature errors, which affect the energy (and pressure) through the heat conduction term. We demonstrate that the material properties entering the equation of state must be computed according to suitable transport equations in conservative or non-conservative forms; the pressure and temperature must be calculated based on the appropriate properties. To verify the analysis and compute problems with gas/liquid interfaces of relevance, we develop a three-dimensional, high-order accurate, solution-adaptive finite difference framework. In particular, we show that temperatures and pressures may be significantly overestimated in calculations of shock-induced bubble collapse in water if temperature errors are not prevented.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract The Richtmyer-Meshkov instability arises when a shock wave interacts with an interface separating two different fluids. It combines compressible phenomena, such as shock interaction and refraction, with hydrodynamic instability, including nonlinear growth and subsequent transition to turbulence, across a wide range of Mach numbers. This review focuses on the basic physical processes underlying the onset and development of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability in simple geometries. It examines the principal theoretical results along with their experimental and numerical validation. It also discusses the different experimental approaches and techniques and how they can be used to resolve outstanding issues in this field.},

Intro.
RM is driven by baroclinic vorticity created by the misalignment of pressure gradient of the shock and the local density gradient accross the interface.

Examples of RMI: 
1. Inertial confinement fusion causes mixinf of the capsule material and fuel within. (Lindl et. al. 1992).
2. Super nova explosions (Arnett, 2000)
3. Combustion engines (Khokhlov et al.)
4. Promotes fuel and oxidizer mixing in hypersonic engines (Yang, 1993)

@article{Cavalcante2005,
abstract = {Collagen and elastin are thought to dominate the elasticity of the connective tissue including lung parenchyma. The glycosaminoglycans on the proteoglycans may also play a role because osmolarity of interstitial fluid can alter the repulsive forces on the negatively charged glycosaminoglycans, allowing them to collapse or inflate, which can affect the stretching and folding pattern of the fibers. Hence, we hypothesized that the elasticity of lung tissue arises primarily from 1) the topology of the collagen-elastin network and 2) the mechanical interaction between proteoglycans and fibers. We measured the quasi-static, uniaxial stress-strain curves of lung tissue sheets in hypotonic, normal, and hypertonic solutions. We found that the stress-strain curve was sensitive to osmolarity, but this sensitivity decreased after proteoglycan digestion. Images of immunofluorescently labeled collagen networks showed that the fibers follow the alveolar walls that form a hexagonal-like structure. Despite the large heterogeneity, the aspect ratio of the hexagons at 30{\%} uniaxial strain increased linearly with osmolarity. We developed a two-dimensional hexagonal network model of the alveolar structure incorporating the mechanical properties of the collagen-elastin fibers and their interaction with proteoglycans. The model accounted for the stress-strain curves observed under all experimental conditions. The model also predicted how aspect ratio changed with osmolarity and strain, which allowed us to estimate the Young's modulus of a single alveolar wall and a collagen fiber. We therefore identify a novel and important role for the proteoglycans: they stabilize the collagen-elastin network of connective tissues and contribute to lung elasticity and alveolar stability at low to medium lung volumes.},

Sharply defined thresholds of the order of 1 MPa were found with 10 $\mu$s length pulses and roughly twice that value for 1 $\mu$s pulses. The thresholds at 4 MHz are greater than at 1 MHz. The thresholds are comparable for focused and unfocused fields. As would be expected for a cavitation-like phenomenon, temporal average intensity is a very poor predictor of this effect. In the extreme case, lesions were found at temporal average intensities on the order of I mW/cm2.},

The dependence of the density, vorticity, simulated density Schlieren and baroclinic production fields, mixing layer width, circulation deposition, mixing profiles, production and mixing fractions, energy spectra, statistics, probability distribution functions, numerical turbulent kinetic energy and enstrophy production/dissipation rates, numerical Reynolds numbers, and numerical viscosity on the order and resolution is investigated to long evolution times. The results are interpreted using the implicit numerical dissipation in the characteristic projection-based, finite-difference WENO method. It is shown that higher-order higher-resolution simulations have lower numerical dissipation. The sensitivity of the quantities considered to the order and resolution is further amplified following reshock, when the energy deposition by the second shock-interface interaction induces the formation of small-scale structures. Lower-order lower-resolution simulations preserve large-scale structures and flow symmetry to late times, while higher-order higher-resolution simulations exhibit fragmentation of the structures, symmetry breaking and increased mixing. Similar flow features are qualitatively and quantitatively captured by either approximately doubling the order or the resolution. Additionally, the computational scaling shows that increasing the order is more advantageous than increasing the resolution for the flow considered here. The present investigation suggests that the ninth-order WENO method is well-suited for the simulation and analysis of complex multi-scale flows and mixing generated by shock-induced hydrodynamic instabilities.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Computed tomography measurements of chest wall thickness (CWT) suggest that standard-length angiocatheters (4.5 cm) may fail to decompress tension pneumothoraces. We used an alternative modality, ultrasound, to measure CWT. We correlated CWT with body mass index (BMI) and used national data to estimate the percentage of patients with CWT greater than 4.5 cm. METHODS This was an observational, cross-sectional study of a convenience sample. We recorded standing height, weight, and sex. We measured CWT with ultrasound at the second intercostal space, midclavicular line and at the fourth intercostal space, midaxillary line on supine subjects. We correlated BMI (weight [in kilograms]/height(2) [in square meters]) with CWT using linear regression. 95{\%} Confidence intervals (CIs) assessed statistical significance. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey results for 2007-2008 were combined to estimate national BMI adult measurements. RESULTS Of 51 subjects, 33 (65{\%}) were male and 18 (35{\%}) were female. Mean anterior CWT (male, 2.1 cm; CI, 1.9-2.3; female, 2.3 cm; CI, 1.7-2.7), lateral CWT (male, 2.4 cm; CI, 2.1-2.6; female, 2.5 cm; CI 2.0-2.9), and BMI (male, 27.7; CI, 26.1-29.3; female, 30.0; CI, 25.8-34.2) did not differ by sex. Lateral CWT was greater than anterior CWT (0.2 cm; CI, 0.1-0.4; P {\textless} .01). Only one subject with a BMI of 48.2 had a CWT that exceeded 4.5 cm. Using national BMI estimates, less than 1{\%} of the US population would be expected to have CWT greater than 4.5 cm. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound measurements suggest that most patients will have CWT less than 4.5 cm and that CWT may not be the source of the high failure rate of needle decompression in tension pneumothorax.},

A diagnostic ultrasound machine (HDI 5000; Philips Healthcare, Andover MA USA) with 7.6 MHz (CL15-7) linear array was used to image the right lung of anesthetized rats in a warmed water bath. The image showed rapid initiation and progression of comet tail artifacts across the lung image for an on-screen mechanical index (MI) of 0.9, which corresponded to a pulmonary hemorrhage in the lung. Groups of rats were scanned at a range of MI settings and a threshold was located at an MI of about 0.44. This finding indicated a greater sensitivity to pulmonary ultrasound than was expected, based on previous results. Further research is needed to understand this phenomenon and to develop safety guidelines for sonographers.},

abstract = {Pulmonary ultrasound examination has become routine for diagnosis in many clinical and point-of-care medical settings. However, the phenomenon of pulmonary capillary hemorrhage (PCH) induction during diagnostic ultrasound imaging presents a poorly understood risk factor. PCH was observed in anesthetized rats exposed to 1.5-, 4.5- and 12.0-MHz diagnostic ultrasound to investigate the frequency dependence of PCH thresholds. PCH was detected in the ultrasound images as growing comet tail artifacts and was assessed using photographs of the surface of excised lungs. Previous photographs acquired after exposure to 7.6-MHz diagnostic ultrasound were included for analysis. In addition, at each frequency we measured dosimetric parameters, including peak rarefactional pressure amplitude and spatial peak, pulse average intensity attenuated by rat chest wall samples. Peak rarefactional pressure amplitude thresholds determined at each frequency, based on the proportion of PCH in groups of five rats, were 1.03 ± 0.02, 1.28 ± 0.14, 1.18 ± 0.12 and 1.36 ± 0.15 MPa at 1.5, 4.5, 7.6 and 12.0 MHz, respectively. Although the PCH lesions decreased in size with increasing ultrasonic frequency, owing to the smaller beam widths and scan lengths, the peak rarefactional pressure amplitude thresholds remained approximately constant. This dependence was different from that of the mechanical index, which indicates a need for a specific dosimetric parameter for safety guidance in pulmonary ultrasound.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the threshold and superthreshold behavior of ultrasound (US)-induced lung hemorrhage in adult rabbits to gain greater understanding about species dependency. A total of 99 76 ?? 7.6-d-old 2.4 ?? 0.14-kg New Zealand White rabbits were used. Exposure conditions were 5.6-MHz, 10-s exposure duration, 1-kHz PRF and 1.1-??s pulse duration. The in situ (at the pleural surface) peak rarefactional pressure, pr(in situ), ranged between 1.5 and 8.4 MPa, with nine acoustic US exposure groups plus a sham exposure group. Rabbits were assigned randomly to the 10 groups, each with 10 rabbits, except for one group that had nine rabbits. Rabbits were exposed bilaterally with the order of exposure (left then right lung, or right then left lung) and acoustic pressure both randomized. Individuals involved in animal handling, exposure and lesion scoring were blinded to the exposure condition. Probit regression analysis was used to examine the dependence of the lesion occurrence on in situ peak rarefactional pressure and order of exposure (first vs. second). Likewise, lesion depth and lesion root surface area were analyzed using Gaussian tobit regression analysis. Neither probability of a lesion nor lesion size measurements was found to be statistically dependent on the order of exposure after the effect of pr(in situ) was considered. Also, a significant correlation was not detected between the two exposed lung sides on the same rabbit in either lesion occurrence or size measures. The pr(in situ) threshold estimates (in MPa) were similar to each other across occurrence (3.54 ?? 0.78), depth (3.36 ?? 0.73) and surface area (3.43 ?? 0.77) of lesions. Using the same experimental techniques and statistical approach, great consistency of thresholds was demonstrated across three species (mouse, rat and rabbit). Further, there were no differences in the biologic mechanism of injury induced by US and US-induced lesions were similar in morphology in all species and age groups studied. The extent of US-induced lung damage and the ability of the lung to heal led to the conclusion that, although US can produce lung damage at clinical levels, the degree of damage does not appear to be a significant medical problem.

abstract = {Objective. The purpose of this study was to enhance the findings of an earlier ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage study ( Ultrasound Med Biol 2003; 29:1625-1634rft{\_}id=info{\%}3Apmid{\%}2F14654157genre=articleval{\_}fmt=info{\%}3Aofi{\%}2Ffmt{\%}3Akev{\%}3Amtx{\%}3Ajournal ) that estimated pressure thresholds as a function of pulse duration (PD: 1.3, 4.4, 8.2, and 11.6 {\{}micro{\}}s; 2.8 MHz; 10-s exposure duration [ED]; 1-kHz pulse repetition frequency [PRF]). In this study, the roles of PRF and PD were evaluated at 5.9 MPa, the peak rarefactional pressure threshold near that of the ED50 estimate previously determined. Methods. A 4 x 4 factorial design study (PRF: 50, 170, 500, and 1700 Hz; PD: 1.3, 4.4, 8.2, and 11.6 {\{}micro{\}}s) was conducted (2.8 MHz; 10-s ED). Sprague Dawley rats (n = 175) were divided into 16 exposure groups (10 rats per group) and 1 sham group (15 rats); no lesions were produced in the sham group. Logistic regression analysis evaluated significance of effects for lesion occurrence, and Gaussian tobit analysis evaluated significance for lesion depth and surface area. Results. For lesion occurrence and sizes, the main effect of PRF was not significant. The interaction term, PRF x PD, was highly significant, indicating a strong positive dependence of lesion occurrence on the duty factor. The main effect of PD was almost significant (P = .052) and thus was included in the analysis model for a better fit. Conclusions. Compared with the findings from a PRF x ED factorial study ( J Ultrasound Med 2005; 24:339-348 ), a function that considers PRF, PD, and ED might yield a sensitive indicator for consideration of a modified mechanical index, at least for the lung.},

abstract = {In animal experiments, the pathogenesis of lung hemorrhage due to exposure to clinical diagnostic levels of ultrasound has been attributed to an inertial cavitation mechanism. The purpose of this article is to report the results of two experiments that directly contradict the hypothesis that ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage is caused by inertial cavitation. Elevated hydrostatic pressure was used to suppress the involvement of inertial cavitation. In experiment one, 160 adult mice were equally divided into two hydrostatic pressure groups (0.1 or 1.1 MPa), and were randomly exposed to pulsed ultrasound (2.8-MHz center frequency, 1-kHz PRF, 1.42-micros pulse duration, 10-s exposure duration). For the two hydrostatic pressure groups (80 mice each), 8 in situ peak rarefactional pressure levels were used that ranged between 2.82 and 11.8 MPa (10 mice/group). No effect of hydrostatic pressure on the probability of hemorrhage was observed. These data lead to the conclusion that lung hemorrhage is not caused by inertial cavitation. Also, the higher hydrostatic pressure enhanced rather than inhibited the impact of ultrasonic pressure on the severity (hemorrhage area, depth, and volume) of lesions. These counterintuitive findings were confirmed in a second experiment using a 2 x 5 factorial design that consisted of two ultrasonic pressure levels and five hydrostatic pressure levels (100 mice, 10 mice/group). If inertial cavitation were the mechanism responsible for lung hemorrhage, then elevated hydrostatic pressures should have resulted in less rather than more tissue damage at each ultrasonic pressure level. This further supports the conclusion that the pathogenesis of ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage is not caused by inertial cavitation.},

abstract = {The number of alveoli is a key structural determinant of lung architecture. A design-based stereologic approach was used for the direct and unbiased estimation of alveolar number in the human lung. The principle is based on two-dimensional topology in three-dimensional space and is free of assumptions on the shape, size, or spatial orientation of alveoli. Alveolar number is estimated by counting their openings at the level of the free septal edges, where they form a two-dimensional network. Mathematically, the Euler number of this network is estimated using physical disectors at a light microscopic level. In six adult human lungs, the mean alveolar number was 480 million (range: 274–790 million; coefficient of variation: 37{\%}). Alveolar number was closely related to total lung volume, with larger lungs having considerably more alveoli. The mean size of a single alveolus was rather constant with 4.2 × 106$\mu$m3 (range: 3.3–4.8 × 106$\mu$m3; coefficient of variation: 10{\%}), irrespective of the lung size. One cubic m...},

Using micropipettes we placed such droplets on the alveolar surfaces of excised rat lungs held at functional residual capacity and 37 degrees and found that the surface tension remained below 9 mN/m for at least 30 min.

abstract = {Atomization and fountain formation is a well-known phenomenon that occurs when a focused ultrasound wave in liquid encounters an air interface. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been shown to fractionate a tissue into submicron-sized fragments in a process termed boiling histotripsy, wherein the focused ultrasound wave superheats the tissue at the focus, producing a millimetre-sized boiling or vapour bubble in several milliseconds. Yet the question of how this millimetre-sized boiling bubble creates submicron-sized tissue fragments remains. The hypothesis of this work is that the tissue can behave as a liquid such that it atomizes and forms a fountain within the vapour bubble produced in boiling histotripsy. We describe an experiment, in which a 2 MHz HIFU transducer (maximum in situ intensity of 24 000 W cm(-2)) was aligned with an air-tissue interface meant to simulate the boiling bubble. Atomization and fountain formation was observed with high-speed photography and resulted in tissue erosion. Histological examination of the atomized tissue showed whole and fragmented cells and nuclei. Air-liquid interfaces were also filmed. Our conclusion was that HIFU can fountain and atomize tissue. Although this process does not entirely mimic what was observed in liquids, it does explain many aspects of tissue fractionation in boiling histotripsy.},

In order to determine whether a comparable outcome could occur in a larger animal with characteristics similar to humans, studies were performed with monkeys using a clinical scanner under maximum output conditions (imaging + pulsed and color Doppler; derated pr of 3.7 MPa [4.5 MPa, measured in water], 4 MHz; MI ∼ 1.8) (N = 57). Monkeys ranged in age from 1 day of life to 16 years with exposures limited to the right lung lobes (5 min cranial, 5 min caudal; N = 41 exposed, N = 12 sham-exposed controls, N = 4 colony controls). Results showed that animals ranging in age from 3 months to 5 years (mean age of 2.5 years) had a greater propensity for the occurrence of multiple well-demarcated circular hemorrhagic foci (0.1–1.0 cm), which were not observed in either control group. These lesions were characterized by marked congestion of alveolar capillaries with accumulation of red blood cells within the alveolar spaces, and were unassociated with major vessels or respiratory bronchioles. Further studies will be required in order to determine the relevance of these findings to the human, although it was concluded that ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage in the monkey is of a significantly lesser degree when compared to the mouse.},

abstract = {The evolution of an unbounded inviscid free surface subjected to a velocity potential of Gaussian form and also to the influence of inertial, interfacial and gravitational forces is considered. This construct was motivated by the occurrence of lung haemorrhage resulting from ultrasonic imaging and pursues the notion that bursts of ultrasound act to expel droplets that puncture the soft air-filled sacs in the lung plural surface, allowing them to fill with blood. The tissue adjacent to the sacs is modelled as a liquid and the air–tissue interface in the sacs as a free surface. The evolution of the free surface is described by a boundary-integral formulation and, since the free surface evolves slowly relative to the bursts of ultrasound, they are realized as an impulse at the free surface, represented by the velocity potential. As the free surface evolves, it is seen to form axisymmetric surface jets, waves or droplets, depending upon the levels of gravity and surface tension. Moreover the droplets may be spherical and ejected away from the surface or an inverted tear shape and fall back to the surface. These conclusions are expressed in a phase diagram of inverse Froude number Fr−1 versus inverse Weber number We−1. Specifically, while axisymmetric surface jets form in the absence of surface tension and gravity, gravity acts to bound their height, rendering them waves, although instability overrides the calculation prior to its reaching that bound. Surface tension acts to suppress the instability (provided that We−1 {\textgreater} 0.045) and to form drops; if sufficiently strong it can also damp the evolving wave, causing it to collapse. The pinchoff which effects spherical drops is of power-law type with exponent 2/3, and the universal constant that relates the necking radius to the time from pinchoff, thereby realizing a finite-time singularity, has the value {\$}{\{}\backslashmathfrak{\{}K{\}}{\}} \backslash,{\{}={\}}\backslash, 0.45 \backslashpm 0.025{\$}. Finally, drops can occur once the mechanical index, a dimensional measure used in ultrasonography, exceeds 0.5.},

Clinical and radiographic examination of the children was performed at the age of 5 years. Results: Caries experience in the 5-year-old children was low; 89{\%} had no caries experience (d(3-5) mft = 0). In multiple logistic regression having one or both parents of non-western origin (OR 3.4, CI 1.6-7.3), having had a change in family status from pregnancy to 5 years of age (OR 2.0, CI 1.1-3.4) and having mother with low education (OR 1.9, CI 1.3-2.8) were statistically significant risk indicators for having caries experience at the age of five. Conclusion: Family characteristics in pregnancy and early life were associated with caries experience in 5-year-old children. Primary care personnel meeting young children with one or several of these characteristics should consider referring the child to dental personnel to enable early initiation of health-promoting activities.},
