\section{Elastic and inertial stresses in the ultrasound-driven alveolus}
To access the importance of interface elasticity in the system
dynamics we calculate and compare expected inertial and elastic forces
at the interface. To compute the elastic forces we assume a linear
stress-strain relationship based on the strain of the interface as
defined in Chapter \ref{ch:usbe_lung_bio}. Upper and lower bounds are
computed based on Alveolar Young's Moduli provided by
\cite{Perlman2014}, which range from $G=0.4$ kPa to $12$ kPa depending
on the transpulmonary pressure.
