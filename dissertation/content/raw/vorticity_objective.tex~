The objective of the present study is to provide a detailed
explanation of the physics governing a perturbed water-air interface
driven by a trapezoidal acoustic wave. This separate from previous
research, which has largely looked at constantly-accelerated and
shock-accelerated interfaces. Consequently, there are physically novel
aspects of the present study.  First, acoustic waves, which are
typically thought of as small amplitude are shown to drive
perturbation growth at the interface via baroclinic vorticity. Shock
waves are, by definition, discontinuous and hence their propagation is
a nonlinear process. In contrast, the propagation of acoustic waves in
a homogeneous medium is a linear process. In the present study
nonlinearity occurs as a result of the strong density discontinuity at
the liquid-gas interface. Second, the acoustic wave has a finite
duration. Hence the vorticity is deposited throughout a finite
interaction time, unlike in the case of the \ac{RMI} in which it is
created by an instantaneous acceleration or the \ac{RTI} in which
vorticity results from constant acceleration. Unlike shocks, which
occur over a few molecular mean free paths and interact nearly
instantaneously, acoustic waves occupy a finite space. Hence their
interaction with interfaces occurs over a finite time. And third,
interface deformation that occurs during the acoustic wave-interface
interaction cannot be neglected. Transient interactions between
deforming interfaces and multiple shocks are known to be capable of
affecting the long term growth of the
interface. \cite{HenrydeFrahan2015b} demonstrated that interface
growth could be controlled through transient wave-interface
interactions by simulating shock passage through layered media, as a
result of subsequent interactions between the interfaces and reflected
and transmitted shocks and rarefactions. This work demonstrates that
interface deformations that occur during the interaction with the
acoustic wave can have a strong effect on the final growth of the
interface.
