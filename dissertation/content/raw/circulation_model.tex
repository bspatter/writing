\section*{Circulation Model}
We now seek to develop a model to predict the circulation deposited during the interaction between a linear compression or expansion wave and the water-air interface. To develop the model we assume that the interface is approximately static during this interaction and maintains its initial sinusoidal shape. Based on% \hl{\eqref{eq:vorticity_comparison}} we assume that all of the vorticity generated is baroclinic.

Hence we write,
\begin{align*}
\Gamma = \int_{0^+}^{\Delta t_a}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\int_{1/2}^{1} \frac{\nabla \rho \times \nabla p}{\rho^2} \diff x \diff y \diff t
\end{align*}
