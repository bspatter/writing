Michigan Matlab @ home

1. Download Matlab from the ME repository and install using given keys.

2. Put license.dat into licenses folder in the matlab root.

3. Change license.dat to:
SERVER localhost 0 1709
USE_SERVER

4. Change network.lic to:
SERVER localhost 0 1709
USE_SERVER

5. Go to hosts file (/etc/hosts in linux or see "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)" for other systems.
Below the line that looks like "127.0.0.1 localhost": 
add the followingline: "127.0.0.1 	localhost LICENSE_SERVER"

6. Open ssh tunnel for the two needed ports to whatever computer you have access to that actually has access to the license (ie, your lab computer).
In linux it will look something like:
"ssh -f -x -L 1709:license-matlab-research.engin.umich.edu:1709 -L 20008:license-matlab-research.engin.umich.edu:20008 username@LabComputer.engin.umich.edu sleep 60;

7. Provide your password when requested.  (or setup passwordless ssh for your personal machine to your work machine as explained here: "http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html"

8. Launch matlab within 60 seconds (or whatever you used as your sleep command). 
at terminal $ matlab -desktop






I use the following shell script and launcher to make this easier:

shell script: runmatlab.sh
## >>
#!/bin/sh

ssh -f -x -L 1709:license-matlab-research.engin.umich.edu:1709 -L 20008:license-matlab-research.engin.umich.edu:20008 username@MyLabComputer.engin.umich.edu sleep 30

nohup matlab -desktop -hgVersion 2
##


Ubuntu launcher file: matlab.desktop
## >>
#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open
