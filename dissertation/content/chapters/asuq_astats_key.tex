In this chapter we present the highlights of past work in which we
develop and test a computationally efficient method for predicting
acoustic \ac{TL} in uncertain ocean environments. This work was
presented at the 169$^{\text{TH}}$ meeting of the Acoustical Society
in Pittsburgh, PA on May 28, 2015 \citep{Patterson2015} and submitted
for review to the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America on
February 22, 2016. Here we present the abstract, introduction, key figures, and
conclusions of the submitted work.

\section{Key figures}
The four ocean test environment of interest, labeled 1 through 4 and
ordered according to their maximum depth from shallowest to deepest,
are shown in cross section in Figure \ref{fig:asuq_astats_bathy}.

To illustrate the problem setup, Figure \ref{fig:asuq_astats_schematic}
depicts the sound source, area statistics sample area, and the five
uncertain parameters of interest: bathymetry offset $\Delta z$, sound speed increment
multiplier $\gamma$, seabed density $\rho_b$, seabed sound speed $c_b$, and seabed
attenuation $\alpha_b$.

To demonstrate the area statistics procedure in Figure
\ref{fig:asuq_astats_example} the range-depth location of (5720 km,
240 m) in environment 2 for a 200 Hz sound source. the \ac{TL} sample area
is indicated by the black box near the center of the \ac{TL} field plot
(Top). The \ac{TL} sample area is shown in an expanded view (Bottom-left)
and is comprised of 720 individual \ac{TL} samples.  Two-dimensional linear
interpolation is used to increase the number of range columns in the
computational grid such that the final normalized histogram is
comprised of 1715 \ac{TL} samples. The area-statistics-estimated PDF of \ac{TL}
developed from these \ac{TL} samples is shown (Bottom-right).


The $L_1$ error-norm is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:asuq_astats_L1}
for engineering-level-accurate (Left) and -inaccurate (Right)
estimates for the \ac{PDF} of \ac{TL}. In both panels, the jagged marked area is
the $L_1$ error. The engineering-level-accurate result (Left) comes from the range-depth
location (5720 m, 288 m) in environment 2, and the mean and standard
deviation of the area statistics \ac{PDF} (solid curve) are 1.23 dB and
1.02 dB smaller, respectively, than those of the \ac{MC} \ac{PDF}
(dashed curve). The engineering-level-inaccurate result (Right) comes from the
range-depth location (1140 m, 384 m) in environment 2, and the mean
and standard deviation of the area statistics \ac{PDF} (solid curve) are
0.86 dB and 1.92 dB smaller, respectively, than those of the
\ac{MC} \ac{PDF} (dashed curve).


For an overall accuracy assessment of the area statistics method, the
$L_1$ error was computed on a coarse rectangular grid in each of the
four uncertain ocean environments. The results are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:asuq_astats_field_results} as a grid of test locations
overlaid on the baseline \ac{TL} field for a 200 Hz source in each
environment. The number and position of test locations were chosen
based on the physical geometry and computational grid spacing in each
environment without consideration for the results at the test
locations. The number of test locations was increased in environment 4
due its larger physical size. Test points below the ocean floor were
not considered. In each panel of Figure
\ref{fig:asuq_astats_field_results}, a white circle indicates a test
location where the area-statistics estimated \ac{PDF} of \ac{TL} was found to be
engineering-level accurate $(L_1 < 0.50)$, while a black triangle
indicates a test location where engineering-level accuracy of the
area statistics estimated \ac{PDF} of \ac{TL} was not achieved $(L1 â‰¥ 0.50)$.

\section{Conclusions} \label{section:asuq_astats_conclusions} This
paper describes the area statistics technique for efficiently
estimating \ac{TL} uncertainty in underwater acoustics. The technique
is based on the idea that the \ac{TL} variation found near the point
interest in real space is similar to that found at the location of
interest when environmental parameters are varied. The technique is
simple and can be used to produce approximate \acp{PDF} of \ac{TL} in uncertain
ocean sound channels from a single (baseline) \ac{TL} field calculation
completed using the most probable value for each uncertain
parameter. To implement the technique, \ac{TL} values near a location of
interest in the baseline \ac{TL} field are collected and sorted into a
histogram that is normalized to obtain an approximate \ac{PDF} of \ac{TL} at the
location of interest. To determine the technique's accuracy, \acp{PDF} of
\ac{TL} created using area statistics were compared to \acp{PDF} generated using
1000-sample \ac{MC} calculations in four different ocean
environments at three acoustic frequencies ($f_s=100, 200, \text{and} 300$ Hz) for
three different source depths ($z_s=91, 137, \text{and} 183$m). The area-statistics
\acp{PDF} of \ac{TL} achieved engineering-level accuracy ($L_1\leq0.5$) in 93\% of
test cases in the three shallower environments with consistent bottom
reflection. In the environments where refraction was more important,
area statistics was less successful; engineering level accuracy was
only achieved in 56\% of test cases, initially.  However, this success
percentage was improved to 65\% by gently modifying the area
statistics algorithm, and this modification did not affect the results
in the shallower ocean environments.

The effort reported here supports the following four conclusions. (1)
The area statistics technique is a viable alternative, or worthy
complement, to \ac{MC} calculations or other more computationally
intensive techniques for estimating the uncertainty of \ac{TL} field
calculations in uncertain ocean environments with consistent
downward-refraction and bottom reflection. In each of the three
environments of this investigation meeting this bottom reflection
criterion, the technique produced engineering-level accuracy at 85\%
or more of the test locations. (2) The area statistics algorithm is
simple enough that it can be modified to improve the technique's
overall performance. One simple algorithm adjustment improved the
engineering accuracy success rate of area statistics in the deepest
environment considered in this study by approximately 10\% at all
three frequencies. (3) The area statistics technique is so inexpensive
computationally that it should be implemented even when a more
reliable but more computationally demanding approach is the primary
means for \ac{TL} uncertainty estimation. As part of this
investigation, the area statistics approach was found to be millions
of times faster than \ac{MC} calculations. Thus, the computational
penalty for implementing both, if the latter is preferred, is
vanishingly small. Moreover, the technique is computationally
inexpensive enough for use in real time applications. (4) The sample
rectangle size, \ac{TL} sample weighting, and other implementation
details of the area statistics algorithm described here are likely to
need adjustment if the ocean sound channel uncertainties of interest
differ from those considered. The area statistics technique is ad-hoc
and the implementation parameters in its current formulation were
tuned to achieve a high percentage of engineering-accurate predictions
for ocean sound channels with the uncertainties considered. However,
the uncertainties considered are generic and may serve as a useful
starting point for many uncertain ocean sound channels. Thus, the area
statistics formulation provided here may be broadly applicable.
