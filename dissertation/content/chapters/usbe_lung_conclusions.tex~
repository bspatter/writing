\section{Conclusions}
In this work we aim to (1) develop an understanding of the fundamental
physics governing acoustically perturbed liquid-gas interfaces, and
(2) apply this understanding to the problem of \ac{DUS}-induced
\ac{LH} in order to determine a physically feasible damage
mechanisms. In our efforts to accomplish the first objective we have
done the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a model of \ac{DUS} wave-alveolus interaction
\item 
\end{itemize}
