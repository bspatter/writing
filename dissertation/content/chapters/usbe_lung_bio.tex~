In the Chapter \ref{ch:usbe_lung} we introduced the problem of
\ac{DUS}-induced lung hemorrhage, however the focus was on the
fundamental physical problem of an acoustically driven gas-liquid
interface, such as those of the alveoli. In this chapter we aim to
extend that work to increase its relevance to \ac{DUS} of the
lung. Here, we hypothesize that \ac{DUS} may be capable of generating
sufficient baroclinic vorticity at alveolar interfaces in the lung to
drive deformation and hemorrhage. To investigate this hypothesis I
examine the dynamics of water-air interfaces driven by ultrasound
pulses and compare the dynamics to those expected of a vorticity
driven ultrasound based on the work of Chapter
\ref{ch:usbe_lung}. Furthermore, to access the potential relevance of
this work to diagnostic ultrasound, we simulate gas-water interfaces
driven by \ac{US} pulses within the clinically relevant range and
calculate stresses and strains at the interface. Where possible
compared to alveolar expected damage thresholds based on previous
research.

\section{Introduction}
Lung \ac{US} has become a common tool for imaging and diagnostics in
critical and point-of-care situations and its use is growing
\citep{Lichtenstein2009}. Currently, \ac{PH} is the only biological
effect known to occur in mammals as a result of non-contrast
diagnostic ultrasound and it has been shown to occur under clinically
acceptable parameters with \ac{MI}$\leq1.9$ \citep{FDA1997} and peak
pressures as low as $1$ MPa \citep{Dalecki1997}. The physical
mechanism underlying this damage is still not well understood. And
while the occurrence of hemorrhage as a result of diagnostic lung
\ac{US} has not been directly studied in human lungs for obvious
ethical reasons, an understanding of the underlying cause is important
for the development of safe guidelines and procedures.

In Chapter \ref{ch:usbe_lung}, the body of literature covering
research into the physical mechanisms of \ac{DUS} was reviewed, so
only a brief summary will be provided here. Pulmonary damage induced
by pulsed ultrasound is characterized by hemorrhage of plasma proteins
and erythrocytes into the alveoli \cite{Penney1993a}. Alveolar edema
or frank hemorrhage has also been shown to occur as a result of
mechanical stress failure of the alveolar membrane induced by over
pressure \citep{West1991}. \ac{DUS}-induced hemorrhage in the lungs
appears mechanical in nature and thermal mechanisms appear unlikely
\citep{Zachary2006, Dalecki2004}. Among possible mechanical damage
mechanisms cavitation, acoustic radiation force, acoustic fountaining
or atomization have all been considered. Experimental results suggest
that neither inertial cavitation nor radiation force can completely
explain the damage \citep{OBrien2000, Raeman1996, Miller2016}. This
work aims to use numerical experiments to investigate the stresses and
strains imparted by an ultrasound pulse on a perturbed liquid-gas
interface, similar to those of the alveoli.

The anatomical structure of the lungs has been studied extensively and
is of particular interest to the present work. The alveoli can be
thought of as a network of openly connected, air-filled saccules with
distinctly irregular surfaces. And while alveoli are irregularly
shaped and do not have a true diameter, past research suggests that
their size appears to be species dependent \citep{Faffe2002}. Mean
alveolar diameters range from tens to hundreds of microns with
vreported values of 45 $\mu$m in mice \cite{Knust2008} and 200 $\mu$m
in adult humans \cite{Ochs2004} for examples. The septa that separate
adjacent alveoli are nearly planar structures that contain several
tissue layers and are coated with a thin layer of liquid surfactant
\citep{Gil1979,Reifenrath1975,Perlman2014}. Among the tissue layers
surrounding the alveoli is a sheet-like web of blood-filled
capillaries. These pulmonary capillaries are almost completely
unsupported by surrounding tissue \cite{West1991}. Separating the
blood from the air is a multi-layer wall of tissues, $0.2$ - $0.3\mu$m
thick, referred to as the blood-gas or \ac{BAB} \citep{West2000}. The
extreme thinness of this barrier is necessary for efficient gas
exchange. The physical dimensions of the alveolus and thinness of this
barrier relative to typical \ac{US} wavelengths are of importance to
the model used in this study.

In addition to anatomical structure, the mechanical properties and
failure behavior of alveoli and other relevant pulmonary tissues have
been studied extensively in computational and animal
models. \cite{Perlman2014} combined experimentally measured strains
with computationally modeled lung stresses to demonstrate that the
effective Young's moduli of aveolar septa depend on transpulmonary
pressure. Values range from $E_a=12$ kPa at a low transpulmonary
pressure around $0.4$ kPa to $E_a=140$ kPa at a high transpulmonary
pressure of approximately $2$ kPa. \cite{West1991} raised the
pulmonary capillary pressure of anesthetized rabbits and observed
consistent stress failure of the capillary and alveolar epithelium for
transmural at or above $40$ mmHg ($5.3$ kPa). This failure
corresponded to a $\sim25$ mN/m wall tension in the capillaries, which
is ``comparable with the tension in the alveolar wall''. The capillary
wall stress at failure was calculated to be approximately $8$
kPa.%
\begin{comment} This is roughly consistent with
  \cite{Welling1972} which measured properties of basement membranes
  from rabbit renal tubules and showed that a $57 \mu$m tubule could
  withstand $4.1$ kPa transmural pressure, which, based on a Laplace
  relationship, equates to an ultimate tensile strength of 500 kPa
  \citep{West1999}. Furthermore, \cite{Welling1972} also showed that
  properties of these tubules depended only on the strength of their
  basement membrane.
\end{comment}%

Alveolar strain response has also been previously studied. Linear,
alveolar strain due to normal tidal breathing is in the range of
$0$-$5$\% for humans \citep{Roan2011}. And \cite{Vlahakis2000} reports that
alveolar plasma membranes resist lateral tension and fail under
stresses greater than $0.4-0.6$ Pa, which corresponds to strains of
$2-3\%$. However, this work also acknowledges that typical changes in
cellular surface area are primarily a result of plasma membrane
unfolding and not actual wall strain. \citep{Belete2010} found that
when subjected to cyclical linear stretch at 0.5 Hz for 30 minutes,
rat alveolar epithelial cells experiencing Linear strains of $8\%$ or
greater were frequently damaged, whereas those experiencing strains
of $3 - 6\%$ often undamaged. 

Based on the work the previous chapter and the past research of
alveolar stress and strain failure we investigate the role of pulsed
ultrasound in possible stress and strain failure of alveoli. In this
chapter numerical experiments to simulate the dynamics of gas-liquid
interfaces driven by ultrasound pulse waveforms within the clinically
relevant range. Specifically, based on the work of Chapter
\ref{ch:usbe_lung}, we look for vorticity driven strains of the
interface, and establish simple models for computing the associated
passive viscous and elastic stresses. The computed stresses and
strains are compared to established failure criteria for alveoli to
access the relevance of this work to \ac{DUS} induced lung hemorrhage.

\section{Methods}
Much of the basic problem setup, computational framework, and solution
setup laid out in Chapter \ref{ch:usbe_lung} are used here. In this
section we will focus specifically on three specific areas where
changes have been made to increase the relevance of the problem to
diagnostic ultrasound: (1) Problem geometry, (2) The acoustic wave,
(3) The calculation of stress and strain.

\subsection{Problem geometry}
In the previous section, we simulated trapezoidal acoustic waves
impinging upon a nearly planar interface with a sinusoidal
perturbation. The width of the domain represents a signle alveolar
diameter, $\ell$. The amplitude $a_0$ of this pertubation was $0.03\%$
its wavelength, again $\ell$, and for the sake of our simulation
corresponds $3\%$ the diameter of an alveolus. This implies a nearly
flat alveolar surface, which as we can see is not always the case,
based on the histological cross section of alveoli shown in Figure
\ref{fig:alveolar_histology}. To account for the variety of geometries
in alveolar tissue, many of which are not particularly flat, we will
now also consider perturbation amplitudes of $a_0=0.1\ell$ and
$a_0=0.3\ell$. We note that this in no way accounts for the range of
cross-sectional alveolar geometries that can exist, but we are limited
by computational constraints and our ability to resolve small scale
features that appear for larger perturbations and sharper geometries.

\end{figure}
% 
\subsection{Modeling the diagnostic ultrasound pulse}
The diagnostic ultrasound pulse is modeled as a sinusoidal carrier
wave of amplitude $p_a$ and frequency $f$ modulated by a Gaussian
Envelope such that,
\begin{align}
  p(x,t_0) = p_a\sin{\left(2\pi f\frac{\left[y-\left(Y_{wave}+L_{wave}\right)\right]}{c}\right)}\exp{\left(-\frac{\left(\left[y-\left(Y_{wave}+L_{wave}/2\right)\right]c\right)^2}{FWHM/\left(2\sqrt{2\ln{\left(2\right)}} \right)}\right)}.%
\end{align}
\begin{figure}
  \centering

  % \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figs/lung_figs/}
  \caption{\label{fig:alveolar_histology} Sample ultrasound pulse waveform}
  % \end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

The carrier wavelength $\lambda=c_{water}/f$ and the full width of the
Gaussian envelope at half of the maximum amplitude ($FWHM$) are
designed to scale appropriately with respect to $\ell$. Here, we
choose design parameters of $f\approx 1.25 c_{water} / 2\pi \ell$ and
$FWHM=15\ell$ such that for an alveolar length scale of
$\ell=200 \mu$m, the corresponding center frequency is $f=1.65$ MHz
and $FWHM=3$ mm. $L_{wave}=45\ell$ is the length of the portion of the
computational domain, over which the wave is defined to exist, such
that the approximate duration of the wave-interface interaction is
just under $6 \mu$s. $Y_{wave}$ is $y$-location of the bottom of the
wave at $t=0$, which is set to $10a_0$ above the peak of the
interface. 

\subsection{Stress and strain at the alveolar interface}%
\label{subsec:usbe_lung_bio_stress_strain}
To interpret the results of the numerical experiments to be performed
in the context of \ac{DUS}-induced lung injury, we aim to compare to
accepted stress and strain injury criteria for lung tissue. To do this
we calculate the strain of the air-water interface and the passive
viscous stress in the field. We note that from the available strain
and strain rate data, it would be possible to compute a passive total
viscoelastic stress at the interface if an acceptable constitutive
model were available. However, constitutive models appropriate to this
work do not appear available at this time and the development of such is beyond the scope of
this dissertation.%
\begin{comment}
  For sake of justification of the model, a simple model for
  estimating the order of magnitude of the involved elastic forces can
  be found in \ref{app:lung_elastic}
\end{comment}

\paragraph*{Calculation of the viscous stress}
We aim to calculate an approximate viscous stress, however because we
solve the Euler equations our simulations are inherently of an
inviscid flow. We do this because, while the justifications in Chapter
\ref{ch:usbe_lung} suggest that flow dynamics can be reasonably
approximated by neglecting viscosity, to understand the results in the
context of alveolar injury, an understanding of the approximate
viscous stress associated with \ac{DUS} is essential. To do this, we
calculate a passive viscosity at each point in space and time as
$\mu(x,y,t)$ based on the physical properties of air and water, and
the volume fraction of water $\alpha(x,y,t)$ such that
$\mu = \alpha\mu_{water} + (1-\alpha)\mu_{air}$. The shear stress for
a two-dimensional, Newtonian flow is calculated using the computed
viscosity field and the velocity gradients as
\begin{align}
  \tau_{xy}(x,y,t) = \mu\left(\frac{du}{dy}+ \frac{dv}{dx}\right).
\end{align}
The maximum viscous stress is extracted from the field. As will be
shown, this maximum occurs as the interface and as such, it will be
compared to relevant stress failure criteria.
% 
\begin{comment}
  \begin{align}%
    \tau_{ij}=\mu%
    \begin{bmatrix}%
      0 & \frac{du}{dy}+\frac{dv}{dx}\\%
      \frac{dv}{dx}+\frac{du}{dy} & 0%
    \end{bmatrix}%
  \end{align},
\end{comment}
% 
\paragraph*{Calculation of the interface strain}
The interface strain is calculated as 
\begin{align}%
  \label{eq:linear_strain}%
  \varepsilon = \frac{s(t) - s_0}{s_0}
\end{align}
where $s$ is the arc length of the interface.  This is consistent with
previous alveolar strain calculations by \cite{Roan2011}, which used
the relative change in alveolar diameters, which is analagous to the
interface arc length here.

\section{Results and Discussion}
To accomplish the aims of this study , two sets of experiments are
performed. The first set of experiments is designed to determine the
relevant stresses and strains on a perturbed-air water interface,
driven by clinically relevant ultrasound waves. The second set of
experiments is designed to test the hypothesis that \ac{US} pulse are
capable of generating sufficient baroclinic vorticity at an air water
interface to drive appreciable interface deformation. Here we describe
the first set of experiments. Simulations of interactions between
sinusoidally perturbed water-air interfaces and diagnostic ultrasound
pulses were performed for wave amplitudes of $p_a=1$, $2.5$, and $5$
MPa and initial perturbation amplitudes of $a_0=0.03\ell$, $0.1\ell$
and $0.3\ell$. The second set of experiments is designed to determine
if the observed interface deformations from \ac{DUS} pulses can be
attributed to baroclinic vorticity. These experiments will be
described in greater detail in Section
\ref{subsec:vorticity_experiments}.

\subsection{Qualitative observations of the interface}
Figures \ref{fig:rho_snapshots_A10}, \ref{fig:rho_snapshots_A25}, and
\ref{fig:rho_snapshots_A50} show density contour snapshots of the
interface for pulse amplitudes of $1, 2.5,$ and $5$ MPa respectively
at dimensionless times $t/(\ell/c_{air})=1, 10, 100,$ and $500$. In
each case, subfigures \subref{fig:rho_snapshot_03},
\subref{fig:rho_snapshot_10}, and \subref{fig:rho_snapshot_30}
correspond to initial perturbation amplitudes of
$a_0=0.03\ell, 0.1\ell,$ and $0.3\ell$ respectively. For a $200 \mu$m,
alveolar diameter, these times approximately corresponds to times at
$0.6, 6, 60,$ and $288 \mu$s. $t=1$ occurs just after the wave first
encounters the interface and $t=10$ is approximately when it has
completely passed the interface. For the $p_a = 1$ MPa pulse case seen
in Figure \ref{fig:rho_snapshots_A10}, the interface remains largely
unmoved and undeformed by the interaction with the wave, even at late
times. For the $p_a = 2.5$ MPa pulse case, little deformation is
observed for $a_0 = 0.03\ell$, however at higher initial amplitudes
$a_0 = 0.1\ell$ and $0.3\ell$, the interface is clearly deformed and a
cusp is observed to form along the interface, at $x = 0.5$ at late
times. For the $p_a = 5$ MPa pulse, obvious deformation is observed
for all considered values of $a_0$. For $a_0 = 0.1\ell$ and $0.3\ell$,
a spike of heavy fluid with a cusp at $x = 0.5$ is again observed to
form at late times.  For all incoming waves, the degree of deformation
appears to increase with increasing initial perturbation amplitude
$a_0$ and wave amplitude $p_a$. The observed sharp features, which
evolved from an initially smooth interface perturbation, could
potentially lead to stress concentration which in aveoli, may lead to
hemorrhage.

\subsection{Interface strain, $\varepsilon$}
In consideration of strain-induced damage of the alveolar wall, the
linear strain histories $\varepsilon(t)$, as defined in Equation
\eqref{eq:linear_strain}, are plotted for each unique combination of
wave amplitude $p_a$ and perturbation amplitude $a_0$. We will first
examine the dependence of strain on $p_a$ and $a_0$ and then discuss
the results in the context of \ac{DUS}.

To illustrate the dependence of the interface strain on the pulse
amplitude $p_a$, Figure \ref{fig:pa_dependence_strain} plots
$\varepsilon(t)$ for $p_a = 1$ (blue), $2$ (red), and $5$ (green)
MPa. Subfigures \subref{fig:strain_multi-pa_a03},
\subref{fig:strain_multi-pa_a10}, and \subref{fig:strain_multi-pa_a30}
correspond to initial perturbation amplitudes
$a_0 = 0.03\ell, 0.1\ell,$ and $0.3\ell$ respectively. Similarly, to
illustrate the dependence of $\varepsilon(t)$ on the initial
perturbation amplitude $a_0$, Figure \ref{fig:a0_dependence_strain}
shows a subset of this data re-plotted for fixed $p_a$. Strain
histories $\varepsilon(t)$ are shown for $a_0 = 0.03\ell$ (blue),
$0.1\ell$ (red), and $0.3\ell$ (green). Subfigures
\subref{fig:strain_multi-a0-A25} and \subref{fig:strain_multi-a0-A50}
correspond to constant $p_a = 2.5$ and $5$ MPa respectively. For all
pressure amplitudes $a_0$ and initial perturbation amplitudes $a_0$,
negative strain is observed during and immediately following the
wave-interface interaction, indicating a net compression of the
interface. This compression is observed to correspond to the
flattening of the interface perturbation during and after the
interaction with the acoustic pulse. For the $p_a = 1$ MPa wave and
all $a_0$ and the $2.5$ MPa wave with $a_0 = 0.03\ell$ and $0.1\ell$,
this compression is observed to slowly continue at a decreasing rate
throughout the duration of the simulation. An expansion or stretching
of the interface follows the compression at late times, for the for
the $p_a = 5$ MPa with any $a_0$, and also for the $p_a = 2.5$ MPa
wave with $a_0 = 0.3\ell$. Based on Figures
\ref{fig:rho_snapshots_A25} and \ref{fig:rho_snapshots_A50} we can see
this that this corresponds to the growth of the aforementioned fluid
spike. It is observed that this deformation and strain increase takes
place long after the passage of the wave, when the acoustic pressure
is negligible. As explained in Chapter \ref{ch:usbe_lung}, the
deformation cannot be explained by linear acoustics, which predicts
little to no deformation after the passage of the wave.

Unsurprisingly, the strains observed rise with increasing $p_a$ and
$a_0$. The minimal strain case is observed to occur for the smallest
considered initial perturbation and wave amplitudes, $a_0 = 0.03\ell$
and $p_a = 1$ MPa respectively. For this case, the greatest observed
strain, $\varepsilon=0.001$ occurs at the final computed time
$t = 500$. Conversely, the maximum strain case occurs for the largest
considered initial perturbation and wave amplitudes, $a_0 = 0.3\ell$
and $p_a = 5$ MPa respectively. For this case, the maximum strain
observed at the final computed time $t = 500$ and is
$\varepsilon+0.38$. In the interest of increasing the relevance of the
presented work to \ac{DUS}-induced lung hemorrhage we consider the
presented strain results relative to the $8\%$ strain failure criteria
\citep{Belete2010}. This threshold was exceeded for two cases, both
with $p_a = 5$ MPa. For the cases with $a_0 \geq 0.1\ell$ and
$0.3\ell$ the strain exceeds the $\varepsilon=0.08$ threshold at
$t = 171$ and $t = 377$ respectively. For a $200 \mu$m alveolus, this
would occur at approximately $100$ and $220 \mu$s.

\subsection{Viscous stress}
In consideration of the viscous stress we are primarily interested in
the potential for viscous stress-related damage of the alveolar
walls. Thus we consider the point along the interface, at which the
viscous stress is greatest. We observe, somewhat unsurprisingly, that
this stress occurs during the wave-interface interaction, and in
particular occurs near the time when the maximum pressure amplitude
encounters the interface. To illustrate the viscous stress around the
interface, color contours of the viscous stress fields are provided
for the $p_a = 5$ MPa case in Figure \ref{fig:tauxy_snapshots} at
$t=2.9\mu s$, approximately when the acoustic pulse and viscous stress
are at their maximum amplitudes. Subfigures
\ref{fig:tauxy_snapshot_A50_a03}, \ref{fig:tauxy_snapshot_A50_a10},
and \ref{fig:tauxy_snapshot_A50_a30} again correspond to respective
initial perturbation amplitudes of $a_0 = 0.03\ell, 0.1\ell,$ and
$0.3\ell$. Black lines indicate isocontours of the volume fraction of
water $\alpha = 0.5$. The maximum viscous stress is observed to occur
in the lighter region of the interface, in which the fluid is mostly
air and the velocity gradients are greatest. At this point in time, the
fluid around the interface has had little time to accelerate as a
result of the wave and consequently the interface remains largely
undeformed.

For each of the initial perturbation amplitudes $a_0$, Figure
\ref{fig:pa_dependence_stress} shows the maximum viscous stress
amplitude $\abs{\tau_{xy}}_{max}$ in the field as a function of time
for $p_a = 1$ (blue), $2.5$ (red),and $5$ (green) MPa pulses. During
the wave interaction, $\abs{\tau_{xy}}_{max}$ oscillates with the wave
around a mean value which appears to rise and fall with the acoustic
intensity. For a given $a_0$, barring chronologically local
oscillations, $\abs{\tau_{xy}}_{max}$ increases with increasing
$p_a$. As $a_0$ is varied for fixed $p_a$, two effects are
observed. First, as $a_0$ increases, the maximum viscous stress
appears less oscillatory, or more precisely, the amplitude of
oscillations in $\abs{\tau_{xy}}_{max}$ relative to the chonologically
local mean, decreases. As a result of the varying degree of
oscillation the second observation is slightly less obvious from the
figures. This is that as $a_0$ increases, the chronologically local
mean value of $\abs{\tau_{xy}}_{max}$ appears to increase as
well. After the passage of the wave, the maximum shear stress drops to
nearly zero in all cases.

In consideration of \ac{DUS}, we note that for the parameters
considered here the maximum viscous stress amplitudes observed at the
interface occur during the interaction with the wave and ranged from
$2 < \left|\tau_{xy}\right| \leq 58$ Pa. Even the greatest observed
stress is two orders of magnitude smaller the $8$ kPa minimal stress
failure threshold observed by \cite{West1991} for disruption of
alveolar epithelium. These stresses occurred during the wave-interface
interaction, and quickly fell off thereafter, in much less time than a
typical period between pulses ($\sim 1$ ms). This suggests that
viscous stresses are not likely to quickly accumulate between
pulses. A possible, exception to this could occur if the velocity
field were to change significantly as a result of accumulated
vorticity from subsequent \ac{US} pulses. The computational cost of
testing this possibility is not feasible under the current framework,
and as such is beyond the scope of this work.

\subsection{Ultrasound induced vorticity dynamics and interface growth}
\label{subsec:vorticity_experiments}
Having examined the stresses and strains associated with an air-water
interface driven by \ac{US} pulses within the regime relevant to
clinical \ac{DUS}, we now aim to determine if interface deformations
that result from \ac{US} pulse waveforms can be attributed to
baroclinic vorticity. To do this, we consider a second set of
experiments, designed to investigate if \ac{US} generated baroclinic
vorticity is the cause of deformations observed as a result of the
ultrasound wave. We will compare the interface and vorticity dynamics
of an ultrasound driven pulse, with those of the trapezoidal pulse of
the Chapter \ref{ch:usbe_lung}. To match the previously considered
parameters for the trapezoidal wave experiments, we consider a
gas-liquid interface with an initial amplitude $a_0=0.03\ell$ driven
by ultrasound pulse with amplitude $p_a = 10$ MPa. We note that this
high amplitude is necessary because it allows us to evolve the
interface to its late-time dynamics using much less computational
effort than is required for the weaker waves used to analyze
\ac{DUS}-induced stress and strain. To further facilitate comparison
of these simulations to those of the previous chapter, all results
presented here will be non-dimensionalized by $\ell$ and $c_{water}$
unless otherwise indicated.

To illustrate the vorticity during and after the passage of the wave,
Figure \ref{fig:us_vorticity_snapshot} shows vorticity contours for
the $p_a = 10$ MPa case at $t/(\ell c) = 4.75$ and $90$ (or $t = 0.6 $
and $12 \mu$s). It can be clearly seen that vorticity is deposited
along the interface by the ultrasound wave, and remains after its
passing. Figure \ref{fig:us10_circulation_history} plots the
right-half domain circulation history during the wave interaction and
shortly thereafter. The end of the interaction between the incident
wave and the interface is indicated as a black, dashed vertical line
$t = 47.5$. It can be seen that the wave deposits circulation, which
remains, and is approximately constant, after its passage. In
consideration of a quantitative, cumulative measure of vorticity
deposited by the ultrasound wave we integrate the vorticity at over
the right-half domain for each point in time to obtain the
circulation, $\Gamma(t)$. The circulation left at the end of the wave
is approximately $3 \times 10^{-4}$, which is roughly $1/5$ that left
by the $p_a = 10$ MPa trapezoidal wave. We note that unlike the
trapezoidal wave, which had a consistently positive, input pressure,
the \ac{US} pulse consisted of cyclic positive and negative pressures,
such that each subsequent cycle is expected to deposit vorticity of
sign opposite that of the previous cycle, since a phase change does
not occurring during the wave interface interaction. Hence it is
perhaps unsurprising that less circulation is deposited by the
ultrasound pulse than for the trapezoidal wave of equivalent maximum
amplitude. As in the previous chapter, the circulation in the left half of the
domain is equal an opposite such that the total circulation is zero.

Similar circulation histories for the $p_a = 1, 2.5,$ and $5$ MPa
simulations, used in the earlier stress and strain calculations, are
provided in Appendix \ref{sec:us_pulse_circulation}, and reveal that
similar to the $p_a = 10$ MPa case, circulation remains after the
passage of the wave. Appendix \ref{sec:us_pulse_circulation} also
explores the dependence of that circulation on $a_0$ and $p_a$ for the
case of the ultrasound pulse.%

in Chapter \ref{ch:usbe_lung} and find that $n = 0.57$. This is
clearly inline with what is expected of baroclinic vorticity driven
growth, based on the work of Chapter \ref{ch:usbe_lung}.

%
% In Chapter \ref{ch:usbe_lung} it was demonstrated that interface
% deformations that occurred following trapezoidal acoustic waves were
% indeed driven by baroclinic vorticity. And at the beginning of this
% chapter, we hypothesized that ultrasound waves may also be capable of
% generating baroclinic vorticity at alveolar interfaces within the
% lungs, and thus capable of inducing strains which may partially
% account for some of the lung hemorrhage observed as a result of
% \ac{DUS}. Unlike the trapezoidal waves of Chapter \ref{ch:usbe_lung},
% which had positive definite pressure profiles, the \ac{US} waves have
% cyclically positive and negative pressure profiles, which we
% intuitively expect to deposit vorticity of opposite sign on each
% subsequent cycle, and thus less total circulation after the passage of
% the wave.

After the passage of the \ac{US} pulse, there are no obvious
mechanisms, beside baroclinic vorticity, to drive the continued
deformation of the interface. As such, it is worth discussing what
precisely contributes to the circulation remaining after the passage
of the wave. Throughout the wave-interface interaction, the interface
itself deforms such that while \ac{US} pressure gradient is
continuously misaligned with portions of the interface density
gradient, the degree to that misalignment changes in time. While this
deformation appears to be nominally small based on the density
snapshots provided in Figures \ref{fig:rho_snapshots_A10},
\ref{fig:rho_snapshots_A25}, \ref{fig:rho_snapshots_A50}, it is
measurable and critical to the vorticity dynamics. Because the
pressure returns to ambient after the passage of the wave, it must be
true that the integral of the acoustic pressure gradient over all time
is zero, just as it was for the trapezoidal wave. Thus the only way
that baroclinic vorticity can remain after the passage of the wave is
though changes in the density gradient. As the interface deforms the
direction these small changes in the direction and local magnitude of
the density gradient result in a net deposition of circulation that
remains to deform the interface after the passage of the wave. This
has particular relevance to ultrasound which relies on many subsequent
pulses, potentially resulting in the accumulation of vorticity over
time.
% 
\subsection{Results summary and further Discussion}
\label{sec:usbe_lung_bio}
In summary, \ac{US} pulse waves were simulated propagating from water
into sinusoidal air-water interfaces to model a single \ac{US}-pulse
impinging upon an alveolus from surrounding soft tissue. To calculate
stresses and strains relevant to \ac{DUS}, nine cases were considered
in which pulses with peak amplitudes of $p_a = 1, 2.5,$ and $5$ MPa
were each propagated at perturbed interfaces of amplitude
$a_0= 0.03\ell, 0.1\ell,$ and $0.3\ell$. For a typical alveolar size
of $200 \mu$m, the maximum simulation time was approximately
$288 \mu$s. Relevant calculations of the density fields, viscous
stress fields, and interface strain within the simulated period are
reported. For each case, vorticity was observed to be generated at the
interface by the wave-interface interaction with varying amounts of
total circulation remaining after the passage of the wave. The
interfaces continued to deform after the passage of the wave. The
computed peak interface strain amplitudes ranged from
$0.01 \leq \varepsilon \leq 0.38$. During the computed period, only
for the $5$ MPa did a single pulse induce strains exceeding the 8\%
threshold, reported by \cite{Belete2010}. The computed peak stresses
were of order $\sim\orderof{Pa}$, far below the $8$ kPa stress failure
criterion reported by \cite{West1991}.

A second experiment was performed to determine if baroclinic vorticity
was the driver of the observed deformation. For this experiment, a
$p_a = 10$ MPa pulse was propagated toward a perturbed water-air
interface of amplitude $a_0 = 0.03\ell$ and the vorticity and
interface dynamics were compared to those of the trapezoidal waves in
Chapter \ref{ch:usbe_lung}. Here it was found that ultrasound pulses
deposited circulation of similar morphology and order of magnitude to
those previously seen for the trapezoidal waves. Furthermore, the
perturbation was found to grow approximately as $t^{3/5}$, as was
expected for baroclinic vorticity driven growth.

\section{conclusions and future work}
\label{sec:usbe_lung_bio_conclusions}
This work is a first step toward investigating the possibility of
baroclinic vorticity in the lungs as potential mechanism of
ultrasound-induced alveolar hemorrhage. This work is novel in its
modeling of \ac{DUS} driven alveoli as perturbed gas-liquid interfaces
and in its use of the equations of fluid motion to compute the
dynamics of the system. Furthermore, this work is unique in its
comparison of calculates alveolar stresses and strains with previously
determined failure criteria.

While the calculated stresses and strains observed based the
interaction between an air water interface and a single ultrasound
pulse may be representative of a portion the of the physics associated
with \ac{DUS}-alveolar interactions, we cannot confidently say that
baroclinic vorticity is the likely cause of \ac{DUS}-induced
hemorrhage in the lung. However, based on the work reported here, we
draw the following conclusions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Newtonian, viscous stress alone is unlikely to be
    sufficient to cause \ac{DUS}-induced hemorrhage of the alveolar
    wall}. While many approximations and simplifications were made
  throughout the course of this work, the work presented estimates
  \textit{worst case} viscous shear stresses. In spite of this, the
  calculated shear stresses are multiple orders of magnitude beneath
  those expected to cause failure of the alveolar wall.
\item \textbf{\ac{DUS} pulses within clinically relevant regimes have
    the potential to deposit baroclinic vorticity within gas-liquid
    interfaces in the lungs, which is capable of driving strain and
    deformation.} This work clearly demonstrates that ultrasound
  pulses interacting with material interfaces similar to those in the
  lung are capable of creating lasting baroclinic vorticity. For the
  $10$ MPa case, the interface exhibit similar growth to those driven
  by trapezoidal waveform, $a(t) \sim t^{3/5}$, long after the wave
  has left the interface. For weaker waves, running the simulations to
  late enough time to observe this was too computationally costly to
  be done. This indicates that ultrasonically driven vorticity is a
  viable mechanism for driving the observed growth. The observed
  interfacial strains created by pulses as weak $p_a = 5$ MPa were
  more than sufficient to cause damage based on previously observed
  alveolar failure criteria. Furthermore, based on dimensional
  arguments, dissipation of the observed vorticity is expected to
  occur over multiple milliseconds, which is greater than the typical
  time between subsequent \ac{DUS} pulses. Hence \ac{US} may be
  capable of accumulating vorticity in the lungs over several
  subsequent pulses and thus driving greater deformation.
\end{enumerate}

There are unsurprisingly several limitations to this study that do not
allow the simulated physics to fully capture the physics of diagnostic
ultrasound-alveolar interactions. These limitations, include but are
not limited to: the use of a simple geometry that does not capture the
inhomogeneity or 3D nature of the physical problem; the neglect of
physical effects including such as surface tension, elasticity,
viscosity, and heat transfer; the use of a single ultrasound pulse is
used instead of many consecutive pulses. Based on our physical
understanding, it is not unreasonable to speculate about how each of
these limitations is likely to effect the simulated physics and offer
further recommendations for next steps to accommodate some of
limitations.

While the geometry used in this study is overly simple, it also
reflects what could be as a \textit{best case scenario} in terms of
baroclinic vorticity generation. The orientation of the mean interface
and small perturbation amplitudes relative to what is actually seen in
alveoli create a somewhat minimal misalignment between the interface
density gradient and \ac{US} pressure gradient, resulting in
potentially less baroclinic vorticity generation for a given wave than
might be expected. In contrast, the physical effects neglected largely
work in favor of increasing the simulated baroclinic vorticity and
subsequently driven interface growth. We expect that viscous effects
will dissipate kinetic energy and spreading the observed
vorticies. However, based on dimensional arguments, this dissipation
is expected to occur over timescales of approximately
$\sim\ell^2/\nu$, which is multiple miliseconds, such that we
anticipate viscous effects will only be important when considering
multiple pulses. The elasticity of the alveolar wall is expected to
induce an elastic stress in the wall, compression, followed by tension
based on the observed strain curves, which will resist the motion of
the wall. While this tensile stress may be an additional mechanism of
damage, the strain in the alveolar wall is likely to be less than
calculated here. Additionally, this model does not allow for the
possibility of mechanical failure of the interface and resulting
discontinuities and hemorrhage into the alveolar space. Furthermore,
as has been mentioned several times, our observed results suggest that
the use of many sequential pulses in physical diagnostic ultrasound is
one that may have significant impact on the vorticity and interface
dynamics. As we have observed in our work, vorticity left after the
passage of the ultrasound led to significant deformation of the
interface, over time periods far less than the time periods that occur
between subsequent \ac{US} pulses. The potential for accumulation of
vorticity, and increased deformation seems plausible based on our
results. The ability to capture failure behavior is likely to be
particularly important in the case multiple pulses with more realistic
geometries, because failure of the interface and subsequent hemorrhage
into the alveolar airspace may allow for a means by which
ultrasound-induced hemorrhage can propagate into additional alveolar
layers. The improvement of the methods used here to overcome these
limitations offers rich opportunities for future studies.

Finally, in addition to the limitations of the present work, there are
definitive limitations of the existing body of knowledge on the
mechanical properties and failure behavior of alveolar tissue under
stresses and strains within the ultrasonic regimes. Poor
characterization of the viscoelastic behavior of alveolar walls makes
determining which physical effects govern the behavior of the system
uncertain. Additionally, the available stress and strain failure
criteria for alveoli are based on much slower processes than occur
during \ac{DUS}, making for an imperfect comparison at best. While
models such as this one may offer insight into physics and potential
physical damage mechanisms of \ac{DUS} induced lung hemorrhage, a much
better understanding of the physical properties and mechanical
behavior of the alveoli will be necessary if models such as this one
are ever to be used to predict hemorrhage.

% \begin{comment}
%   Previously there has been extensive research
%   investigating interactions between fluid-fluid interfaces driven by
%   mechanical waves. Much of this work has been motivated by man-made
%   applications such as inertial confinement fusion and astrophysical
%   phenomena such as supernova collapse. Accordingly much of the previous
%   research has focused on shock-accelerated, perturbed interfaces
%   between fluids of different densities
%   \citep{Brouillette2002}. \cite{Taylor1950} performed linear stability
%   analysis for the case of a perturbed interface between two fluids
%   undergoing constant acceleration, e.g., gravity. Taylor found that
%   under certain configurations the interface perturbation
%   grows. \cite{Richtmyer1960} extended this linear analysis to the case
%   of an impulsively accelerated interface to create a model for the
%   initial growth of a shock-driven interface perturbation. Later,
%   \cite{Meshkov1969} experimentally confirmed Ricthmyer's qualitative
%   predictions. Hence the growth of a shock-driven fluid-fluid interface
%   has been labeled as the \ac{RMI}. To lend physical insight into the
%   underlying mechanism behind this, \cite{Hawley1989} demonstrated that
%   this phenomenon could be described using vortex deposition-evolution
%   paradigm. The basic mechanism driving the growth of the perturbation
%   in the case of the \ac{RMI} is baroclinic vorticity created by the
%   misalignment of the pressure gradient across the shock and the density
%   gradient at the interface. Recently \hl{Patterson \& Johnson
%   (submitted, 2016)} performed numerical experiments and analysis to
%   show that for the case of liquid-gas interfaces, acoustic waves may
%   also be capable of depositing sufficient baroclinic vorticity at the
%   interface to cause significant deformation, as a result of the sharp
%   density gradient across the interface.

%   \section{Methods}
%   In this section we develop a model of \ac{DUS}-alveolus interaction
%   as a compressible fluid system. We then describe in detail the setup
%   of the numerical experiments performed and calculations performed to
%   investigate the problem. 

%   \subsection{A model of \ac{DUS}-alveolus interaction}
%   \hl{COPIED THIS PARAGRAPH TO OTHER PAPER}.  Consider a \ac{DUS} pulse
%   as it travels into the lungs. After passing through layers of soft
%   tissue and fluid, the wave encounters a network of openly connected,
%   air-filled saccules with distinctly irregular surfaces. These are the
%   alveoli. It is the interaction between an incident \ac{US} pulse and
%   the first alveolar tissue-air interface it encounters that we treat
%   here, as shown in figure \ref{fig:alveolar_schematic}.

%   To model the problem, we consider a rectangular domain with a 2D
%   $(x,y)$ cross section containing soft tissue (modeled as water)
%   sitting atop a single alveolus (modeled as air) as illustrated in
%   figure \ref{fig:ic_schematic}. An acoustic pulse is prescribed within
%   the water, above the interface, and allowed to propagate downward
%   ($-y$-direction) toward the air. The alveolus spans the width of the
%   domain, $\ell$. A typical mean aveolar diameters in an adult human is
%   $200 \mu$m \citep{Ochs2004}.

%   To capture the irregular shape of the alveolus, the water-air
%   interface contains a single mode sinusoidal perturbation of amplitude
%   $a_0$ such that the vertical center of the interface is described by,
%   \begin{align} %Not y_interface in the code
      %       Y(x,t=0)_{interface} = a_0\sin\left(\frac{2\pi x}{\ell}-\frac{\pi}{2}\right). 
      %     \end{align}
      %       An interface thickness $\delta=0.08$ is chosen such that at $t=0$, the
      %       fluid in the domain above $y\geq Y_{interface}+\delta/2$ is pure
      %       water, and below $y\leq Y_{interface}-\delta/2$ is pure air, which a
      %       water-air mixture filling the region around the interface. A more
      %       detailed treatment of the interface can be found in referred to
      %       \hl{(Patterson and Johnsen, 2016)}. To investigate the dependence of
      %       the dynamics on the alveolar geometry we will consider multiple
      %       interface perturbation amplitudes: $a_0=0.03\ell, 0.1\ell, 0.2\ell,$
      %       and $0.3\ell$.

      %       The diagnostic ultrasound pulse is modeled as a sinusoidal carrier
      %       wave of amplitude $p_a$ and frequency $f$ modulated by a Gaussian
      %       Envelope such that,
      %       \begin{align}
      %       p(x,t_0) = p_a\sin{\left(2\pi f\frac{\left[y-\left(Y_{wave}+L_{wave}\right)\right]}{c}\right)}\exp{\left(-\frac{\left(\left[y-\left(Y_{wave}+L_{wave}/2\right)\right]c\right)^2}{FWHM/\left(2\sqrt{2\ln{\left(2\right)}} \right)}\right)}.%
      %     \end{align}
      %       The carrier wavelength $\lambda=c_{water}/f$ and the full width of the
      %       Gaussian envelope at half of the maximum amplitude $FWHM$ are designed
      %       to scale appropriately with respect to $\ell$. Here,
      %       $f\approx 1.25 c_{water} / 2\pi \ell$ and $FWHM=15\ell$. For an
      %       alveolar length scale of $\ell=200 \mu$m, this corresponds to $f=1.65$
      %       MHz and $FWHM=3$ mm. $L_{wave}=45\ell$ is the length of the
      %       computational domain, over which the wave is defined to exist and
      %       $Y_{wave}$ is $y$-location of the bottom of the wave at $t=0$, which
      %       is set to $10a_0$ above the peak of the interface. To consider the
      %       dependence of the interface dynamics on pulse amplitude we vary
      %       $p_a = 1, 5, 10,$ and $15$ MPa.

      %       \subsection{Governing Equations}
      %       To simulate the model problem described above we solve equations for
      %       conservation of mass, momentum, energy. While it has been long since
      %       recognized that tissue exhibits viscoelastic behavior
      %       \citep{Bayliss1939}. To simplify things we consider the expected
      %       length scale over which viscosity will influence the dynamics,
      %       $l_{viscous}$. From dimensional analysis, this scales as
      %       $l_{viscous}\sim\sqrt{\nu/(\ell/c)}$. In air at 300 K,
      %       $l_{viscous}\sim\orderof{1 \mu\text{m}}$ and in water
      %       $l_{viscous}\sim\orderof{0.1 \mu\text{m}}$. In either case we consider
      %       that $l_{viscous}<<\ell$. \hl{Furthermore, we consider the relative
      %       importance of elasticity and surface tension }

      %       \subsection{Computational implementation}
      %       The Euler equations \eqref{eq:euler} are solved on a rectangular
      %       computational grid using Discontinuous Galerkin Methods in space and a
      %       fourth order Runge-Kutta time marching scheme as described in
      %       (Patterson and Johnsen, 2016 [submitted]). As previously mentioned the
      %       width of the computational domain is 1 mean alveolar diameter,
      %       $\ell$. The length of the domain is chosen based on two criteria: one
      %       - the domain must fully capture the initial acoustic wave and the
      %       moving interface throughout the simulation, and two - the domain must
      %       be long enough to sufficiently largely eliminate artificial
      %       reflections from the boundaries. Thus the computational domain
      %       considered for this problem is described by $0\leq x\leq1\ell$ and
      %       $-20\ell\leq y\leq 60\ell$. To further help eliminate reflections,
      %       grid stretching is implemented at the top and bottom $10\ell$.
