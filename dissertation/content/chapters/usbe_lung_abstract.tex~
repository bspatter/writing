\subsection{Abstract}
Over the past few decades, \ac{DUS} of the lung has been shown to
cause hemorrhage in a variety of mammals, though the underlying damage
mechanism is yet to be determined. While there do not appear to be
serious health risks associated with this problem under typical
clinical conditions, the use of \ac{DUS} for imaging of the lung is
increasing rapidly. It is important we understand this phenomena to
ensure that lung \ac{DUS} remains safe as new procedures and
technologies are developed. In this work we propose a previously
unconsidered physical damage mechanism for \ac{DUS}-induced \ac{LH} --
misalignments between ultrasound pressure gradients and tissue-air
interface density gradients result in the generation of baroclinic
vorticity. This mechanism would drive fragile cellular barriers around
the alveoli deform and ultimately hemorrhage. To test our hypothesis,
we treat the lung as an inviscid, compressible fluid system and
develop a simplified, numerical model of the problem to simulate
\ac{DUS} pulse-alveolus interaction. We show that acoustic waves, such
as \ac{DUS} pulses, are capable of generating baroclinic vorticity at
sharp liquid-gas interfaces such as those found in the lungs, and that
this drives subsequent deformation of the interface. We propose a
scaling law based on dimensional analysis to predict the growth of a
purely circulation driven interface which we compare to growth
observed in our numerical experiments to verify that vorticity is the
mechanism responsible for the deformation. Finally we suggest future
work to be completed for this dissertation in the upcoming year. We
plan to increase the relevance of this work to lung \ac{US} by using
more realistic geometries and computing theoretical stresses within
the lungs. Additionally we will model the circulation and interface
deformation associated with simple expansion and compression waves and
use these models to design waves for minimal interface growth after
the passage of the wave.
