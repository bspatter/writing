\subsection{Abstract}
Calculations of acoustic transmission loss (TL) in the ocean are
useful in naval and ocean monitoring applications. These TL
calculations are often uncertain because they are based on uncertain
environmental parameters, but standard methods for determining TL
uncertainty are computationally expensive. This paper describes how TL
statistics in a range-depth area surrounding the point of interest
within a single TL-field calculation can be efficiently used to
estimate the probability density function (PDF) of TL that results
from ocean environment uncertainty. Such area-statistics estimated
PDFs of TL are compared to PDFs of TL obtained from 1000-sample
Monte-Carlo calculations at source frequencies of 100, 200 and 300 Hz
and source depths of 91, 137, and 183 m in four different uncertain
ocean environments at test location depths from 20 m to 5 km and
source-receiver ranges from a few km to more than 60 km. These
comparisons show that the estimated PDFs of TL are engineering-level
accurate in 93\% of tests in ocean environments with consistent bottom
reflection, and can be produced with O(10$^{-6}$) the computational effort
required for the Monte-Carlo calculations. In deep refracting
environments, area statistics was engineering-level in 78\% of test
cases after algorithm adjustments.
