The objectives of this part of the presented dissertation work are (1)
to develop models for use in the study of diagnostic ultrasound wave
interactions within tissue and (2) to perform studies to investigate
the physics and fluid mechanics potentially relevant to specific
biological effects of diagnostic ultrasound.

The following work was performed to accomplish the first objective:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{A model for spherical bubble dynamics in tissue, treated as a
    Voigt viscoelastic medium, was developed.}\\
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Viscoelasticity
  \item Experimental ultrasound waves used.
  \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{A novel model of an US pulse driven alveolus was developed.}\\
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\section{US Bubble Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}

\item I calculated the cavitation dynamics of bubbles in a
  viscoelastic media driven by experimentally measured ultrasound pulses
  with known biological effects.
\item Calculated cavitation metrics in a theoretical viscoelastic
  media correlate strongly with experimentally observed bioeffects.
\item Better mechanical characterization of tissue is needed,
  particularly at the time and length scales of cavitation and
  ultrasound.
\item Cavitation dynamics and bioeffects thresholds depend on
  frequency and elasticity.
\item Accepted thresholds for Inertial cavitation in water are not
  likely to apply directly to bioeffects.
\end{itemize}



\section{US Lung Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item A model of an US pulse driven alveolus was developed.
\item The dynamics of an alveolar wall driven by $1.5$ MHz ultrasound
  pulses of $1, 2.5,$ and $5$ MPa amplitudes were simulated.
\item Interfaces were shown to continue straining after interacting
  with the pulse as a result of US-generated baroclinic vorticity. This
  occurred on timescales less than those expected between pulses for KHz
  PRF.
\item Viscous stresses were also computed.
\item Computed stresses and strains were compared to expected values
  from the literature.
\end{itemize}
