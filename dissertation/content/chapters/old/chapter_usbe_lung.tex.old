\section{Introduction}
Over twenty years ago, researchers first observed lung hemorrhage in
mice exposed to lithotripter pulses \citep{Hartman1990}.  Moreover, it
was found that this hemorrhage occured for pressure thresholds as low
as 2 MPa, an amplitude relevant to diagnostic ultrasound, and much
lower than those previously observed for kidney and other soft
tissues.  These findings prompted A follow-up study to access the risk
of pulsed Diagnostic Ultrasound (DUS)-induced hemorrohage, which found
that DUS pulses were indeed capable of causing lung hemorrage, and
that 10$\mu$s DUS pulses had a hemorrhage threshold amplitude of
approximately 1 MPa \citep{Child1990}.

Since the original findings of DUS-induced lung hemorrhage in mice,
there has been considerable work on this topic primarily aimed at
three specific ends: (1) Determining the dependence of damage
characteristics and threholds on the subject, (2) Determining the
dependence of damage characteristics and thresholds on the US
properties, and (3) Investigating the damage mechanism by which the
hemorrhage occurs.  This work is primarily aimed at the third area,
and proposes and proposes US-induced circulation deposition in the
lungs as a potential mechanism for DUS-induced hemorrhage.

Work in the first area has sought to look at the dependence of
DUS-induced hemorrhage on many different properties of the US subject,
and is of importance to accessing the potential risks of US on humans.
There have been many studies in this area, investigating the effects
of age, species, and other test subject characteristics.  As of this
writing, US induced lung hemorrhage has been shown in mice, pigs,
rats, rabbits, and monkeys \citep{Baggs1996, Child1990, Dalecki1997a,
  Dalecki1997, Frizzell1994, Frizzell2003, Harrison1995a, Holland1996,
  Obrien1997a, Obrien2000, Obrien2001a, Obrien2001, Penney1993a,
  Raeman1993, Raeman1996, Tarantal1994a, Zachary1995, Kramer2001,
  Obrien2003a, Obrien2003, Obrien2005, Zachary2001a, Zachary2001}.
\citet{Dalecki1997a} investigated the effect of age on DUS-induced
lung hemorrhage in mice by exposing neonatal, juvenile, and adult mice
to DUS pulses.  The study found that while while hemorrhage thresholds
were similar in all mice, the degree of hemorrhage was much greater in
the adult mice than in the younger subjects.  Similarly,
\citet{Obrien2003a}, studied the age dependance of hemorrhage in pigs,
and found that older pigs had a significantly lower hemorrhage than
juvenile and middle-aged pigs.  In an unexpected result, the study
also found that one lung was exposed to US and the pig was then rolled
over and the second lung exposed, the hemorrhage threshold in the
second lung was substantially lower thanin the first.

The second area, investigating the dependance of lung hemorrhage on US
properties, has seen the largest amount of work and is imporant for
designing US in a way that is capable of high quality diagnostic
imaging while minimizing any unwanted bioeffects.  Research in this
area has looked at the dependance of hemorrohage on US waveform and
dosimetric properties.  \citet{Zachary1995} used continuous-wave and
pulsed-wave US in mice, rabbits, and pigs, and that found that while
the continuous- and pulsed-wave-induced lesions appear macroscopically
similar, they differ microscopically.  Hemorrohage induced by
continuous wave US consisted primarily of plasma and contained some
cells, whereas pulsed-wave induced hemorrhage was composed largely of
cells and contained little plasma.  \citet{Raeman1996} subjected mice
to pulsed ultrasound with varying exposure time and concluded that
while threshold amplitudes appeared insensitive to exposure time,
supratheshold damage increased with increasing exposure.
% A series of studies investigated the effects US Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF), beamwidth, pulse duration, pulse polarity, and
% exposure duration \citep{OBrien2003a,OBrien2006b,OBrien2003,Frizzell2003,OBrien2001a,OBrien2001,OBrien2005}.
\citet{Obrien2001} investigated the effects of US beamwidth and found that as beamwidth increased so did the incidence, surface area, and volume of hemorrhage.  It was noted that lung hemorrhage is perhaps the only known beamwidth-dependent mechanical bioeffect of US.  Evidence has also been found that increaing US pulse duration increases the liklihood of lung hemorrhage in rats \citep{Obrien2003}.





\section{Problem setup and physical model}

\section{Methods}
We consider a portion of the lung's surface and the surrounding
pleural fluid and tissue, which is treated as 2D viscous, compressible
fluid system.  The lung is modeled as air and the surrounding
tissue/fluid as water.  To simulate the problem we use a square
computational domain containing a sinusoidally perturbed water-air
interface !!FIGURE HERE OF LUNG MODEL SCHEMATIC!!.  The initially
perturbed interface is subjected to a pressure wave and allowed to
evolve in time.

\subsection{Numerical implementation}
The compressible Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics are solved
in the domain.  Transport equations are solved in advection form to
capture the interface and prevent pressure oscillations.  A fifth
order finite-volume weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme
with a Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) Riemann solver is implemented to
solve in space.  A 4th order adaptive Runge-Kutta method is used for
time marching.  To generated the incoming pressure wave and eliminate
reflections at left boundary, time-dependent, characteristic boundary
conditions are implemented \citep{Thompson1987}.  Zero-gradient
boundary conditions are imposed at the top, bottom, and right-side of
the domain.
