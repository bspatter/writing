This dissertation will present work using computation to make
advancements in two separate, distinct areas of acoustics: ultrasound
bioeffects and acoustic transmission loss uncertainty quantification
in uncertain ocean environment. Hence this document is split into two
parts along these lines. A summary of relevant background information,
work performed, and conclusions in each area will be presented
separately.
