Professor Dowling,
Below is a list of topics regarding and sections of my prelim document draft that I would most like your feedback on. Any input you have is very much appreciated.

Thanks,
Brandon



□  Is the general structure of the document logical? If not, how could it be improved?



□  Is the foreword (p. 1) an appropriate way to handle the two parts of the document?



□  Is chapter 2 (p. 5) a sufficient introduction to ultrasound bioeffects, given the literature review presented in chapter 4?



□  Please read chapter 4 (p.14) , regarding our work on diagnostic ultrasound induced lung hemorrhage and provide any and all suggestions.



□  Does the document need any closing piece beyond the conclusion to part 2?


□  Are there any parts of this document that you recommend that I cut before sending it out more broadly to my committee once I have completed your and Eric's suggestions?
