  In order to predict bioeffects in contrast-enhanced diagnostic and
  therapeutic ultrasound procedures, the dynamics of cavitation
  microbubbles in viscoelastic media must be determined.  For this
  theoretical study, measured 1.5-7.5 MHz pulse pressure waveforms,
  which were used in experimental determinations of capillary
  breaching thresholds for contrast-enhanced diagnostic ultrasound in
  rat kidney, were used to calculate cavitation nucleated from
  contrast agent microbubbles.  A numerical model for cavitation in
  tissue was developed based on the Keller-Miksis equation (a
  compressible extension of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation for
  spherical bubble dynamics), with a Kelvin-Voigt constitutive relation. From
  this model, the bubble dynamics corresponding to the experimentally
  obtained capillary breaching thresholds were determined. Values of
  the maximum radius and temperature corresponding to previously
  determined bioeffect thresholds were computed for a range of
  ultrasound pulses and bubble sizes for comparison to inertial
  cavitation threshold criteria.  The results were dependent on
  frequency, the gas contents, and the tissue elastic properties.  The
  bioeffects thresholds were above previously determined inertial
  cavitation thresholds, even for the tissue models, suggesting the
  possibility of a more complex dosimetry for capillary injury in
  tissue.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Cavitation-bubble collapse has been a topic of interest in physical
acoustics for nearly a century and has been the object of many
experimental and theoretical studies, which have outlined the
complexity of the phenomenon \cite[]{leighton1997}.  This field made a
landmark contribution to non-ionizing radiation biology in medicine in
the 1980s when the possibility of inertial cavitation, with potential
induction of bioeffects, from diagnostic ultrasound pulses was
predicted theoretically \cite[]{flynn1982,apfel1982}.  This
possibility was included in considerations for the regulation of the
ultrasound output of diagnostic machines.  \cite{apfel1991} performed
detailed calculations of the response of different nuclei sizes in
the form of free air microbubbles and found that the optimum size
decreased with increasing frequency, $f$.  In addition, the
rarefactional pressure amplitude threshold, $p$, for inertial
cavitation was determined for the optimum nuclei, using the criterion
of a $>$5,000 K gas temperature at collapse.  For nuclei in blood, the
ratio of $p^{1.67}/f$ was found to have a constant value of 0.13 at
the threshold, using units of MPa and MHz.  This finding was used to
create a Mechanical Index (MI) for regulatory purposes and for display
on the screens of diagnostic ultrasound machines.  The MI was set
equal to the peak rarefactional pressure amplitude (PRPA) adjusted for
attenuation, and divided by the square root of frequency.  The
regulatory guideline limit for diagnostic ultrasound was considered
according to the Medical Device Amendment Act of 1976 and the maximum
value existing at that time.  This guideline limit was eventually set
from measurements on a single diagnostic ultrasound probe to be 1.9
\cite[]{nyborg2001}.  It is noteworthy that the critical value
corresponding to the \cite{apfel1991} result would be
\textbf{$p/f^{0.6}=0.29$}, which is much less than the MI limit.  This
discrepancy does not appear to be of concern for normal diagnostic
ultrasound from both experimental \cite[]{carstensen2000} and
theoretical \cite[]{church2002} considerations.

To improve diagnostic information in ultrasound examinations,
ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) were invented.  The contrast agents
consist of a suspension of stabilized gas-filled microbubbles, which
provide strong echoes from blood and improve contrast in sonography
\cite[]{averkiou2003, raisinghani2004}.  Soon after contrast-enhanced
diagnostic ultrasound was developed, microscale bioeffects were
reported \cite[]{miller2008a}.  The typical bioeffect seen in
mesentery, muscle, heart, and kidney was capillary rupture, which
appeared to be caused by cavitation nucleation in blood from the
circulating contrast microbubbles.  Recently, hemorrhage of glomerular
capillaries was studied in rat kidney to determine PRPA thresholds and
the frequency dependence of the thresholds \cite[]{miller2008b}.
Presumably, the thresholds correspond to the action of the optimum
cavitation nuclei, and this approach therefore provides a means to
directly compare cavitation theory with the bioeffects experiments.
Over the 1.5-7.5 MHz frequency range tested, the thresholds were
proportional to the frequency, such that $p/f$ was approximately
constant at 0.49 MPa/MHz for actual diagnostic ultrasound and 0.62
MPa/MHz for diagnostic ultrasound simulated by a laboratory
pulsed-ultrasound system.  These thresholds fell below the MI=1.9
level, especially for the lower frequencies, but above the inertial
cavitation thresholds of \cite{apfel1991}, and the frequency
dependence was different.  Evidently, the bioeffects thresholds depend
on cavitation dynamics not specifically tied to the inertial
cavitation threshold of free air bubbles in blood determined by
\cite{apfel1991}.  The fundamental reason for these results remains
uncertain, which revives the non-ionizing radiation biology problem of
ultrasonic cavitation in medical ultrasound.

The theoretical model of \cite{apfel1991} applies to air microbubbles
in a Newtonian liquid. However, contrast agents in the blood stream do
not necessarily exhibit such properties. It is well-known that human
tissue behaves in a viscoelastic fashion
\cite[]{frizzell1976,madsen1983}. The bubble dynamics greatly depend
on not only the viscoelastic properties \cite[]{allen2000a,yang2005}
for a given model, but also on the type of model \cite[]{johnsen2012} and
on nonlinearity \cite[]{allen2000b}.  Furthermore, the gas contained
in contrast agents is not air; for example, perfluoropropane (PFP, C$_3$F$_8$) in
Definity (Perflutren Lipid Microsphere, Lantheus Medical Imaging, N
Billerica MA), which may affect the collapse temperature.  The
stabilizing skin or shell may not be an important factor for the
capillary rupture bioeffect, because the nucleation process appears to
liberate a free gas microbubble. The thresholds for this cavitational
bioeffect are above the destabilization threshold of the optimal
microbubbles, which therefore may be modeled as free microbubbles
\cite[]{sboros2002,marmottant2005}.  Basically, at low PRPAs the
stabilization is lost, which releases a free microbubble, thus
nucleating cavitation, followed by dissolution at the conclusion of
the pulse \cite[]{porter2006}.  In the case of diagnostic ultrasound,
the microbubble is subjected to
a series of pulses that start low, build to a peak and finally
decline.   Thus, when the peak pulse arrives to cause the injury, the 
microbubbles likely are already destabilized.

The detailed mechanism by which cavitation causes bioeffects is
unknown, although several have been proposed, such as shock emission
upon collapse, growth beyond a given size, high temperatures
generating free radicals, re-entrant jets in non-spherical collapse
\cite[]{nyborg2002}. In order for such phenomena to occur, it is
expected that inertial cavitation occurs. From this observation, prior
studies have used the threshold for inertial cavitation as a surrogate
for bioeffects \cite[]{yang2005}. This inertial cavitation threshold
was developed theoretically for bubble dynamics in water
\cite[]{flynn1975}. In this work, we show that the bioeffects
threshold is different from previously developed inertial cavitation
thresholds. The difference between the inertial cavitation threshold
calculated for air microbubbles in blood and the capillary rupture
thresholds is likely due to an incomplete model.  That is, the
homogenous model results may correlate better with the bioeffects
results if tissue elasticity, gas contents, pulse parameters, and
possibly other factors are considered.  

In the current work, a different approach combining experiments and
numerical modeling to studying bioeffects is followed.  \emph{In vivo}
experiments were performed to determine the pulse amplitude and
frequency under which bioeffects occur \cite[]{miller2008b}.  Given
these experimental pulses, bubble dynamics are modeled numerically
over the entire waveform duration, which is not taken into account by
\cite{apfel1991}, to determine how the bubble response correlates with
the observation of bioeffects.  A detailed description of the methodology is
presented. The experimental setup and numerical model are first
discussed in \S \ref{sec:methods}. The results from the combined
experimental and numerical procedure are presented in \S
\ref{sec:results}. The ability of established inertial cavitation
thresholds, and general cavitation parameters, to predict bioeffects
is discussed. The article ends with a summary of the results and
considerations for future work on this topic.




\section{Materials and Methods}
\label{sec:methods}
\subsection{Experimental Setup}

In the previous study of glomerular capillary hemorrhage in rats by
\cite{miller2008b}, bioeffect thresholds were determined for
ultrasound exposure with diagnostic ultrasound machines and with a
laboratory system set up to simulate diagnostic scanning.  The
ultrasonic waveforms (pressure vs. time) used for the driving pressure
in this study were based on the laboratory system bioeffect thresholds
at 1.50, 2.25, 3.50, 5.00 and 7.50 MHz (with corresponding bioeffects
thresholds of 0.98, 1.31, 2.38, 2.82 and 6.00), which allowed more flexibility
in producing the desired pulse waveforms than the diagnostic
ultrasound machine.  

The experiment was designed to simulate worst-case-scenario clinical conditions 
for CEUS. Anesthetized rats were held in place in a 75 L bath of 37$ ^\circ$ C 
degassed water, and exposed to ultrasound while receiving a constant 10 $\mu$l/kg/min 
infusion of UCA.  The ultrasound probe was placed such that its focal zone was at the 
cortex of the right kidney.  The ultrasound system consisted of a transducer, power 
amplifier (A-500, Electronic Navigation Industries, Rochester NY),
function generator (model 3314A function generator, Hewlett Packard
Co., Palo Alto CA).  Five damped single element transducers
(Panametrics, Olympus NDT Inc. Waltham, MA) with 1.9 cm diameter and
3.8 cm focus were used at their resonant ultrasonic frequencies in a
warmed water tank.  The function generator was set using the $n$-cycle
mode with $n=3$ to produce a simple pulse train with pulse durations
and PRPAs the same as used for the \textit{in vivo} exposures.  The waveforms
were measured with a calibrated PVDF bilaminar film hydrophone with
0.4 mm spot size (model 805, Sonora Medical Systems, Longmont CO) and
were adjusted to equal the threshold at each frequency and to several
3 dB increments above and below the threshold.  The purpose of the
progressive steps was to help identify any specific cavity behavior,
which recurred at each frequency as the threshold was crossed.  The
hydrophone measured the alternating pressure including the PRPA, to
which the constant atmospheric pressure must be added
to obtain the total pressure.  The highest PRPA available for the
higher frequencies was limited by the transducers.  The experimental
waveforms are imported into Matlab, and smoothened using a
moving-average low-pass filter. This procedure results in waveforms,
such as that shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:waveforms} for the threshold at
7.5 MHz, in which the high-frequency experimental noise is
removed. The smoothened waveforms are then input into the bubble
dynamics code as the driving pressure.

  \label{fig:waveforms}
\end{figure*}





\subsection{Bubble Dynamics Model}

The bubble dynamics are modeled under the assumption that a single spherical
gas bubble is subjected to a far-field pressure change (ultrasound
pulse) in an infinite medium of uniform properties.  Given that
bioeffects are observed in some of the experiments and that it is
likely that inertial cavitation occurs, it is expected that
compressibility of the surrounding medium matters. Furthermore, tissue
is expected to behave in a viscoelastic fashion. To account for all of
these elements, the Keller-Miksis equation \cite[]{keller1980}, a
compressible extension of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation, is
considered, and the constitutive relation between the stresses and
strains follows a Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic model, as in
\cite{yang2005}. Thus the nondimensional equations governing the
bubble dynamics are:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:keller}
  &&\left(1-\frac{\dot{R}}{C}\right) R \ddot{R} +
    \frac{3}{2}\left(1-\frac{\dot{R}}{3 C}\right) \dot{R}^2 \nonumber  %\\&&
     = \left(1+\frac{\dot{R}}{C}\right) \left[p_B- 1 -p_a -
    \frac{R}{C}\frac{dp_a}{dt}\right] +\frac{R}{C} \dot{p}_B,
\end{eqnarray}
where $R(t)$ is the bubble radius, $C$ is the dimensionless sound
speed, $p_a$ is the
time-varying component of the far-field pressure and the dot
represents material (time) derivatives. The bubble pressure $p_B$ is
given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bubble_pressure}
  p_B = \left(1+\frac{2}{We}\right)\frac{1}{R^{3\gamma}}-\frac{2}{We
  R} + \tau_R,
\end{equation}
where $We$ is the Weber number (dimensionless surface tension),
$\gamma$ is the specific heats ratio for the gas, and
$\tau_R$ is the shear stress in the $rr$-direction
evaluated at $r=R$.

  \label{tab:parameters}
\end{table*}


As in \cite{yang2005}, the Kelvin-Voigt model is used as the
constitutive relation between the stresses and strains:
\begin{equation}
  \tau_R = -\frac{4}{3
  Ca}\left(1-\frac{1}{R^3}\right) - \frac{4}{Re}\frac{\dot{R}}{R},
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%  s = \frac{4}{9
%  Ca}\left(1-\frac{1}{R^3}\right) - \frac{4}{9 Re} \frac{\dot{R}}{R},
%\end{equation}
where $Re$ is the Reynolds number (dimensionless viscosity), and $Ca$ is the Cauchy number (dimensionless elasticity).  The dimensionless numbers are
defined in Table \ref{tab:parameters}.  %The SLS model reduces to the
%linear Maxwell model used by \cite{allen2000a} and to the linear Kelvin-Voigt
%model used by \cite{yang2005} for bubble dynamics in viscoelastic
%media in the context of medical ultrasound.
The resulting system of
equations is solved for the bubble radius using a fifth-order accurate
Cash-Karp Runge-Kutta method with adaptive time-step control. In the
problem under consideration, the pressure pulse is smooth and its
wavelength is on the order of 1 mm. Since the bubbles are initially in
the micron range and do not grow beyond a few initial radii, the
present Rayleigh-Plesset-type approach is justified.



The base values for tissue properties, listed in Table
\ref{tab:parameters}, are taken from the literature
\cite[]{apfel1991,yang2005}. In the present work 
variables are nondimensionalized using a tissue density 
of $\rho=1000$ kg/m$^3$, a characteristic speed given by 
$u=\sqrt{p_{atm}/\rho}$ where $p_{atm}$ is atmospheric 
pressure, and a characteristic equilibrium radius of 
$R_0=1$ $\mu$m. The resulting 
time scale is thus close to the Rayleigh collapse time.  A
range of equilibrium radii within 0.1-2.0 $\mu$m, a typical size
distribution for UCAs, is considered. Thus, changing
the equilibrium radius modifies the nondimensional parameters.
The specific heat is taken 
as $\gamma =1.13$ for perfluoropropane. Reported values of 
tissue elasticity fall in the 1-100 kPa range \cite[]{arda2011%,maxwell2012
}. However, it is known that the elasticity may increase up 
to the MPa range at high strains \cite[]{krouskop1998}.  
Here, a nominal elasticity of $G=100$ kPa is considered as the base case.

Since the thresholds for cavitational bioeffects are above the destabilization 
threshold, the microbubbles are modeled as free bubbles \cite[]{sboros2002,marmottant2005},
\textit{i.e.,} UCA stabilizing films and shells are neglected.
Additionally, the detailed effect of the physical constraint
imposed by blood vessel walls is considered by including it 
in the bulk elasticity of the tissue. Though non-spherical 
perturbations may occur due to the local heterogeneity of tissue and
thus lead to a significant change in the bubble 
dynamics, non-spherical collapse is expected to produce lower
temperatures and pressures \cite[]{johnsen2009}.  In this sense, the spherically symmetric
model represents a worst-case scenario useful in determining safe, 
conservative parameters for CEUS procedures.

 


\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Bubble Response}

Typical bubble responses are first shown to provide a qualitative
understanding of the physics.  Figs.~\ref{fig:sample_bubble_linear},
\ref{fig:sample_bubble_intermediate} and
\ref{fig:sample_bubble_nonlinear} show the history of the dimensionless bubble
radius produced by a given pressure waveform for a range
of essentially linear to nonlinear cases, and different elasticities (5 kPa, 100
kPa and 1 MPa). In the linear case, the bubble oscillations are in
phase with the pressure waveform. Increasing the elasticity leads to
larger oscillation amplitudes, though the changes are small. At
intermediate frequency and amplitude, the oscillations become larger
and more nonlinear for larger elasticities. This observation, although 
seemingly counterintuitive, is
consistent with the results of \cite{johnsen2012}, who showed analytically
that the damping of the oscillations is smaller in this range of
elasticities.  In the fully nonlinear case (large pulse amplitude and
frequency), the oscillation amplitude becomes yet larger, thus
yielding a larger maximum radius and very small minimum radius.  For
all elasticities, the initial behavior is similar up to the second
maximum radius. Thereafter, the stiffer case (G=1 MPa) departs and
collapses violently, while the other cases rebound. The maximum radius
is achieved at approximately the same time in all cases, after the
peak positive pressure. In all the simulations, the oscillations
damp out rapidly after the passage of the pulse.

  \label{fig:sample_bubble_nonlinear}
\end{figure*}

In the results of the following sections, the maximum dimensionless radius,
$R_{max}$, and dimensional bubble temperature at collapse, $T_{max}$, obtained
using the ideal gas law, are determined by recording their largest
value over the simulation. These quantities are compared to the
inertial cavitation thresholds used by \cite{apfel1991} and
\cite{yang2005}: $R_{max}=2$ and $T_{max}=5000$ K. The dependence
of the bubble dynamics on the pulse amplitude, initial
bubble size (\emph{i.e.}, UCA size distribution), 
pulse frequency, and tissue properties are considered
individually. 



\subsection{Dependence on the Pulse Amplitude}

Given the strong dependence of the MI on the rarefactional pressure
amplitude, the influence of the pulse amplitude on the bubble dynamics
is first evaluated. Fig.~\ref{fig:amplitude} shows the dimensionless
maximum radius as a function of rarefactional pressure
amplitude. Initial bubble radii ranging between 0.1--2.0 $\mu$m are
shown, as well as different frequencies. The open symbols denote
cases where bioeffects did not occur, while the filled symbols denote
the occurrence of bioeffects.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Rstarmax_Pm.eps}
  \caption{(color online) Dependence of the dimensionless maximum bubble radius on
    the peak negative pressure for $G=100$ kPa.  Empty symbols: no
    bioeffects; filled symbols: bioeffects. Pentagrams: 0.1 $\mu$m; circles:
    0.5 $\mu$m; squares: 1 $\mu$m; diamonds: 2 $\mu$m; frequency: 1.5 - 7.5 MHz. }
  \label{fig:amplitude}
\end{figure}

The results show that the bubble dynamics, through the maximum radius,
scale with the pulse amplitude. Although the results do not collapse fully
onto a line, a general trend is discernible. At low amplitude, the increase in
the maximum radius is approximately linear; beyond some amplitude, the bubble undergoes
nonlinear oscillations, thus explaining the different depenced and larger spread. 
These results are consistent with the plots shown in 
Figs.~\ref{fig:sample_bubble_linear}-\ref{fig:sample_bubble_nonlinear}.
Over a broad range of amplitudes, the
occurrence of bioeffects has little correlation with pulse amplitude
alone: at a given amplitude, bioeffects may be observed or not,
depending on the bubble size and pulse frequency.  Only at very large
pressure amplitudes (PRPA $>$ 4.20 MPa) are bioeffects systematically observed regardless of the
bubble size and pulse frequency. This behavior is not surprising, since at
these amplitudes the bubble response is expected to be highly
nonlinear. Conversely, at low amplitudes (PRPA $<$ 0.97 MPa), the oscillations are 
linear and no bioeffects are observed, regardless of
bubble size and pulse frequency. In this latter case, most bubbles
whose $R_{max}/R_o$ is below two do not exhibit bioeffects; however,
this behavior depends on the value of elasticity, as shown in \S
\ref{sec:tissue_properties}.  Although not shown here for conciseness,
similar results are obtained for peak positive pressure.


Similarly, the criterion $T_{max} > 5000$ K is not achieved with perfluoropropane.
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:gascontents}, the observed temperatures for
PFP are far below this value, though the results for air approach it. This
result is expected since the criterion was determined for air, which
has a larger specific heats ratio ($\gamma_{air}=1.4$) than
PFP ($\gamma= 1.13$). The specific heats ratio appears in
the internal gas pressure term in Eq.~\ref{eq:bubble_pressure}; its
effect on the bubble dynamics is minor if the minimum radius is not
very small, as in Fig.~\ref{fig:gascontents}. Still, since the
adiabatic relationships for an ideal gas are used, the temperature is
significantly affected by the different specific heats ratio. Hence,
even though the bubble dynamics are not strongly affected by the
specific heats ratio, the maximum temperature is.

\subsection{Dependence on the Initial (Equilibrium) Bubble Radius}

In the experiment, the size distribution of the UCAs is not known
exactly. It is desirable to know whether the observed bioeffects are
caused by all bubbles responding to the ultrasound, or whether a
specific size is more likely to be responsible at the bioeffects
threshold. To answer this question, for each experimental frequency,
bubbles of different radii ranging from 0.1--2 $\mu$m are subjected to
the pressure waveform corresponding to the bioeffects threshold
amplitude. It should be noted that varying the equilibrium radius
changes the non-dimensional parameters. Fig.~\ref{fig:size} shows the maximum dimensionless
radius, for both water (zero elasticity) and tissue (finite
elasticity, $G=100$ kPa), for the amplitude at which bioeffects are
first observed at a given frequency.

\begin{figure}[t]

    \caption{(color online) Dependence of the dimensionless maximum bubble radius on

      symbols: water; filled symbols: tissue. Circles: 1.50 MHz; squares:
      2.25 MHz; diamonds: 3.50 MHz; pentagrams: 5.00 MHz; hexagrams: 7.50 MHz.}
    \label{fig:size}
\end{figure}

Excluding the smallest size, the bubble response in tissue is monotone
and changes little for a given frequency; there is no initial size
that consistently leads to a dramatic response. The somewhat erratic
behavior of the small bubbles may imply that such sizes are not
present in UCA concentrations. On the other hand, the behavior is more
irregular for water, particularly at small radii: for a given
frequency, there is an optimal size that exhibits the largest
response; these variations are much larger than for tissue.  








\subsection{Dependence on the Pulse Frequency}

The dependence of the bubble response on the pulse frequency is
considered in this section.  Fig.~\ref{fig:freq} shows the maximum
dimensionless and dimensional radius for all initial bubble sizes and
amplitudes vs. frequency. The square symbols denote cases in which
bioeffects were observed in the experiments, while the circular symbols
represent no bioeffects. The initial bubble sizes are not
discriminated here for simplicity.

   \caption{(color online) Dependence of the bubble dynamics on the frequency for
     $G=100$ kPa. $R_0=0.1-2$ $\mu$m; empty circles: no bioeffects; squares:
     bioeffects.}
  \label{fig:freq}
\end{figure*}

With the exception of a few outliers, a clear separation between cases
for which bioeffects did and did not occur is observed; in other
words, the bioeffects threshold has a strong dependence on the
frequency. The trend appears to be approximately linear with
frequency. Large growth may be achieved with no evident bioeffects,
especially at high frequencies. The quantity $R_{max}$ is a
measure of cavitation collapse, since it is related to the available
energy of the bubble. Thus, the present results indicate that
cavitation collapse is expected to play an important role regarding
bioeffects, although the precise mechanism cannot be inferred.  Again,
the existing criteria for inertial cavitation thresholds are
frequency-independent and do not correlate well with the bioeffects
threshold, which clearly shows a strong dependence on frequency.

Another hypothesis is that bubble growth may be responsible for
capillary breaching. However, the plot of the dimensional maximum radius vs. frequency does
not show systematic bioeffects beyond a certain size, \emph{e.g.},
some capillary diameter. Thus, growth is not the sole mechanism by
which bioeffects occur. However, the data remains inconclusive,
due to the inability to identify the cases in which cavitation
collapse is the dominant effect.






\subsection{Dependence on the Tissue Properties}
\label{sec:tissue_properties}

As suggested in
Figs.~\ref{fig:sample_bubble_linear}-\ref{fig:sample_bubble_nonlinear},
the bubble dynamics are sensitive to the tissue properties,
specifically the elasticity. However, different types of tissue may
have very different properties. Many of the measurements of tissue elasticity are made
\emph{in vitro}, and depend strongly on tissue preparation, storage,
and degradation as well as method of measurement.  Consequently it is
possible that these measurements do not accurately represent the
current behavior.  To explore the effect of the elasticity on the
results and the correlation to bioeffects, Fig.~\ref{fig:freq_tissue}
shows the maximum dimensionless radius for all initial bubble sizes
and amplitudes vs. frequency for $G=5$ kPa and $G=1$ MPa. Although
seemingly high, the latter elasticity is chosen to match the work of
\cite{yang2005}.

\begin{figure*}[t]
  \subfigure[$G=5$ kPa.]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{Rstarmax_F_Ca=20.eps}
  }
  \subfigure[$G=1$ MPa.]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.47\textwidth]{Rstarmax_F_Ca=0,1.eps}    
  }
   \caption{(color online) Dependence of the dimensionless maximum bubble radius on
     the frequency. $R_0=0.1-2$ $\mu$m; empty circles: no bioeffects; squares:
     bioeffects.}
  \label{fig:freq_tissue}
\end{figure*}

The bubble dynamics and correlation to bioeffects significantly change
when reducing the elasticity. For a value of 5 kPa, the discrimination
is no longer clear. The bubble dynamics are closer to the behavior in
water, such that different sizes may have dramatically different
responses to the same waveform, as explained previously. On the other
hand, the stiffer medium ($G=1$ MPa) shows an even sharper
demarcation, which again appears to be approximately linear. Given the
sensitivity of the results on the elasticity, it is clear that more
precise \emph{in vivo} data is required for elasticities of tissues at the
relevant strain rates. 

Although not shown here, the type of
viscoelastic model significantly affects the bubble dynamics
\cite[]{johnsen2012,patterson2012}. For instance, a standard linear solid
model, which includes stress relaxation in addition to elasticity, leads 
to very different maximum
radii and oscillation properties (frequency and damping).  For
large relaxation times, elasticity variations become negligible.





\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In the present work, a numerical model is used
to investigate experimentally observed bioeffects as a result of
contrast-enhanced ultrasound. This work is unique in its 
combination of experimental results and numerical modeling.
For the experimentally generated input
pressure waveforms, it is known which of these triggered bioeffects,
and from the numerical model we obtained calculated values for
the dimensionless maximum radius and dimensional maximum temperature for each of these cases.  By comparing the
results of this study to previously established inertial cavitation
thresholds used by \cite{apfel1991} and \cite{yang2005},
$T_{max}=5000$ K and $R_{max}=2$, it would appear that the inertial
cavitation threshold does not play a role in determining the bioeffects
threshold.  However, it is unlikely that the inertial cavitation
threshold is irrelevant. Instead, it is far more probable that these
thresholds are not defined appropriately for cavitation in a
viscoelastic medium, such as soft tissue. This work suggests the need for
further experimental and numerical studies of cavitation in viscoelastic media.

The present work shows a strong correlation between cavitation dynamics and bioeffects
when considering the pulse frequency.
From the plot of maximum
dimensionless radius vs. frequency, there is a clear separation
between when bioeffects do and do not occur, and based on these
results it appears that the frequency of the input pressure waveforms
is of key importance to the definition of a bioeffect threshold, and
likely the inertial cavitation threshold as well. 

The present work shows that the elasticity of tissue significantly
affects the bubble dynamics. This finding is perhaps not completely
unexpected given that bubble dynamics are known to strongly depend
on viscoelastic properties and model. The present study shows the need
for more accurate measurements of material properties and for
determining appropriate constitutive models for soft tissue,
particularly at high strain rates. Finally, although the present work
suggests that inertial cavitation collapse plays an important role with respect
to bioeffects, it does not shed light on the exact mechanism,
\emph{e.g.}, shock emission upon collapse, growth beyond a given size,
high temperatures generating free radicals, re-entrant jets in
non-spherical collapse, etc.  In future work we plan on investigating 
this injury mechanism by conducting direct simulations of
the full equations of motion for bubble dynamics in a viscoelastic medium.
