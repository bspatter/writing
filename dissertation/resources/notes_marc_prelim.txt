RM occurs when shock hits perturbed intf between fluids diff density. (Taylor, meshkov)

baro. vort. causes growth. (broullette)

Phase inversion occurs when shock moves heavy to light.

vortex sheet is only thing driving interface deformation after wave. Different velocities at different points along the interface.

This creates bubble, defined as light fluid moving into heavier fluid, and  spike, defined as heavier fluid moving into light fluid.

Brouillette picture illustrates this.
