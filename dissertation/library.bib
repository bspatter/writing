@article{Kull1991,
abstract = {The theory of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of accelerated fluid layers is systematically developed from basic fluid equations. Starting with the classical potential flow theory for moving contact surfaces, the discussion extends to various fluid systems describing inhomogeneous, viscous, compressible, and isobaric flows. Thereby an overview on the major stability issues under a broad variety of physical conditions can be given. In particular, the stability analysis is addressed to layered materials in plane and spherical geometries under various dynamical conditions, to inhomogeneous media with variable gradients and different boundary conditions, to viscous boundary layers, compressible atmospheres, and to stationary ablation fronts in laser-driven plasma experiments. The stability theory is further extended to the nonlinear stage of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability and to a discussion of bubble dynamics in two and three dimensions for closed and open bubble domains. For this purpose simple flow models are studied that can describe essential features of bubble rise and bubble growth in buoyancy-driven mixing layers.},

abstract = {It is well documented that ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage can occur in mice, rats, rabbits, pigs, and monkeys. The objective of this study was to assess the role of the ultrasound beamwidth (beam diameter incident on the lung surface) on lesion threshold and size. A total of 144 rats were randomly exposed to pulsed ultrasound at three exposure levels and four beamwidths (12 rats per group). The three in situ peak rarefactional pressures were about 5, 7.5, and 10 MPa. The four 19-mm-diameter focused transducers had measured pulse-echo -6-dB focal beamwidths of 470 $\mu$m (2.8 MHz; f/1), 930 $\mu$m (2.8 MHz; f/2), 310 $\mu$m (5.6 MHz; f/1), and 510 $\mu$m (5.6 MHz; f/2). Exposure durations were 10 s, pulse repetition frequencies were 1 kHz, and pulse durations were 1.3 $\mu$s (2.8 MHz; f/1), 1.2 $\mu$s (2.8 MHz; f/2), 0.8 $\mu$s (5.6 MHz; f/1) and 1.1 $\mu$s (5.6 MHz; f/2). The lesion surface area and depth were measured for each rat as well as the percentage of rats with lesions per group. Logistic regression analysis and Gaussian-Tobit analysis methods were used to analyze the data. The effects of in situ peak rarefactional pressure and beamwidth were highly significant, but ultrasonic frequency was not significant. In addition, the estimated interaction between in situ peak rarefactional pressure and beamwidth was positive and highly significant. The ultrasound beamwidth incident on the lung surface was shown to strongly affect the percentage and size of ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage lesions. Even though ultrasonic frequency was an experimental variable, it was not shown to affect the lesion percentage or size.},

@book{Boyd2010,
abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57{\%}, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

abstract = {This selective review of the biological effects of ultrasound presents a synopsis of our current understanding of how cells insonated in vitro are affected by inertial cavitation from the standpoint of physical and chemical mechanisms. The focus of this review is on the physical and chemical mechanisms of action of inertial cavitation which appear to be effective in causing biological effects. There are several fundamental conditions which must be satisfied before cavitation-related bioeffects may arise. First, bubbles must be created and then brought into proximity to cells. Exposure methods are critical in this regard, and simple procedures such as rotation of a vessel containing the cells during exposure can drastically alter the results. Second, once association is achieved between bubbles and cells, the former must interact with the latter to produce a bioeffect. It is not certain that the inertial event is the prime mechanism by which cells are lysed; there is evidence that the turbulence associated with bubble translation may cause lysis. Additionally, there appear to be chemical and other physical mechanisms by which inertial cavitation may affect cells; these include the generation of biologically effective sonochemicals and the apparent emission of ultraviolet (UV) and soft X-rays. The evidence for inertial cavitation occurring within cells is critically reviewed.},

@article{Church2002,
abstract = {Gas bubbles of sufficient size to serve as cavitation nuclei may form spontaneously in tissue in regions of very low interfacial tension. In the absence of an acoustic wave or other mechanical stress, such nuclei will quickly dissolve and disappear from the medium. Under the influence of an acoustic wave, however, these microbubbles may grow to many times their initial size and then collapse violently, a process known as inertial cavitation. In this work, the in vivo energetics and dynamics of the nucleation-cavitation process were modeled by treating tissue as a homogeneous fluid. The assumption of a viscosity of 10−3 Pa s (i.e., that of water) resulted in the lowest acoustic rarefactional pressure threshold for nucleation-cavitation events, ∼4.0 MPa, which was essentially frequency-independent over the range 1 to 15 MHz. The rarefactional pressure threshold for a viscosity of 5 × 10−3 Pa s (that of blood) also was ∼4.0 MPa at 1 MHz, but the threshold for this higher viscosity increased nearly linearly with frequency above ∼5 MHz, never being more than ∼0.2 MPa below the equivalent derated peak rarefactional pressure calculated assuming MI = 1.9, the current USFDA guideline.

Intragenic (in the same gene) suppressor mutations that counteract mutations of known properties represent "fixes" or counters to the defect of the starting mutation and thus contain information about driving transitions or stabilizing states of the motor. Due to its variety of myosin-dependent phenotypes, Dictyostelium is a powerful tool for the identification of conditional mutants as well as selection of large numbers of intragenic revertants of a mutant of interest.

abstract = {The use of polynomial chaos for incorporating environmental variability into propagation models is investigated in the context of a simplified one-dimensional model, which is relevant for acoustic propagation when the random sound speed is independent of depth. Environmental variability is described by a spectral representation of a stochastic process and the chaotic representation of the wave field then consists of an expansion in terms of orthogonal random polynomials. Issues concerning implementation of the relevant equations, the accuracy of the approximation, uniformity of the expansion over the propagation range, and the computational burden necessary to evaluate different field statistics are addressed. When the correlation length of the environmental fluctuations is small, low-order expansions work well, while for large correlation lengths the convergence of the expansion is highly range dependent and requires high-order approximants. These conclusions also apply in higher-dimensional propagation problems.},

abstract = {The study objective was to estimate the pressure threshold (ED 05, effective dose, or in situ peak rarefactional pressure associated with 5{\%} probability of lesions) of ultrasound (US)-induced lung hemorrhage as a function of pulse duration (PD) in adult rats. A total of 220 10- to 11-week-old 250-g female Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan) were randomly divided into 20 ultrasonic exposure groups (10 rats/group) and one sham group (20 rats). The 20 ultrasonic exposure groups (2.8-MHz; 10-s exposure duration; 1-kHz PRF; -6-dB pulse-echo focal beam width of 470 ??m) were divided into four PD groups (1.3, 4.4, 8.2 and 11.6 ??s) and, for each PD group, there were five in situ peak rarefactional pressures (range between 4 and 9 MPa). Rats were weighed, anesthetized, depilated, exposed, and euthanized under anesthesia. The left lung was removed and scored for the occurrence of hemorrhage. If hemorrhage was present, the lesion surface area and depth were measured. Individuals involved in animal handling, exposure and lesion scoring were "blinded" to the exposure conditions. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the dependence of the lesion occurrences, and Gaussian tobit regression analysis was used to examine the dependence of the lesion surface areas and depths on in situ peak rarefactional pressure and PD. Threshold results are reported in terms of ED05. For PDs of 1.3, 4.4, 8.2 and 11.6 ??s, respectively, lesion occurrence ED05s were 3.1, 2.8, 2.3 and 2.0 MPa with standard errors around 0.6 MPa. Lesion size ED 05s showed similar values. A mechanical index (MI) of 1.9, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory limit of diagnostic US equipment, is equivalent to the adult rat's in situ peak rarefactional pressure of 4.0 MPa. PDs of 8.2 and 11.6 ??s had ED05s more than 2 standard errors below 4.0 MPa, indicating that the ED05s of these two PDs are statistically significantly different from 4.0 MPa. The ED05 threshold levels for a PD of 1.3 ??s are consistent with previous US-induced lung hemorrhage studies. As the PD increases, the ED05 levels decrease, suggesting greater likelihood of lung damage as the PD increases. All of the ED05s are less than the FDA limit. ?? 2003 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine {\&} Biology.},

abstract = {The nonlinear oscillations of spherical gas bubbles in linear viscoelastic fluids are studied. A novel approach is implemented to derive a governing system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The linear Maxwell and Jeffreys models are chosen as the fluid constitutive equations. An advantage of this new formulation is that, when compared with previous approaches, it facilitates perturbation methods and numerical investigations. Analytical solutions are obtained using a multiple scale perturbation method and compared with the Newtonian results for various Deborah numbers. Numerical analysis of the full equations supports the perturbation analysis, and further reveals significant differences between the viscoelastic and Newtonian cases. Differences in the oscillation phase and harmonic structure characterize some of the viscoelastic effects. Subharmonic excitations at particular fluid parameters lead to a discrete group modulation of the radial excursions; this appears to be a unique, previously undiscovered phenomenon. Implications for medical ultrasound applications are discussed in light of these current findings.},

It was produced as a resource document in response to a request for information by Working Group 12 (Ultrasound exposure parameters) of the International Electrotechnical Commission Technical Committee 87, Ultrasonics. IEC TC 87, WG12 is the working group responsible for generating international standards for the classification of equipment by its acoustic fields based on safety thresholds. Our paper is intended to update and supplement information on the thermal mechanism provided in the publication, “WFUMB Symposium on Safety and Standardisation in Medical Ultrasound: Issues and Recommendations Regarding Thermal Mechanisms for Biological Effects of Ultrasound” (WFUMB 1992). It also provides an overview of trends in research into nonthermal mechanisms as a preliminary to the next WFUMB Symposium on Safety of Medical Ultrasound when this subject will be examined in detail by a select group of international experts. The WFUMB-sponsored workshop will take place in Utsunomiya, Japan during 11–15th July, 1994. The purpose of the meeting is to evaluate the scientific literature and to formulate internationally accepted recommendations on the safe use of diagnostic ultrasound that may be endorsed as official policy of the WFUMB. It should be noted that the current publication is not intended for review or endorsement as an official WFUMB document. It is produced as a scientific paper by individuals who are members of the WFUMB Safety Committee, and it therefore represents the opinions of the authors. Nevertheless, during the preparation of this document, contributions were received from members of the International Electrotechnical Commission Technical Committee 87 as well as many other individual experts, and the authors sincerely acknowledge their support.},

Community Dent Oral Epidemiol 2010. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S Abstract - Objective: The purpose of the study was to explore associations between family status, family income, family size, mother's age at child birth, mother's education and parents' national background and caries experience in 5-year-old children. Method: This study is based on data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the Public Dental Services. A total of 1348 children were followed from pregnancy to the age of 5 years. Questionnaires were completed by mothers twice during pregnancy and when the children were 3 and 5 years of age. Clinical and radiographic examination of the children was performed at the age of 5 years. Results: Caries experience in the 5-year-old children was low; 89{\%} had no caries experience (d(3-5) mft = 0). In multiple logistic regression having one or both parents of non-western origin (OR 3.4, CI 1.6-7.3), having had a change in family status from pregnancy to 5 years of age (OR 2.0, CI 1.1-3.4) and having mother with low education (OR 1.9, CI 1.3-2.8) were statistically significant risk indicators for having caries experience at the age of five. Conclusion: Family characteristics in pregnancy and early life were associated with caries experience in 5-year-old children. Primary care personnel meeting young children with one or several of these characteristics should consider referring the child to dental personnel to enable early initiation of health-promoting activities.},

abstract = {Threshold pressures for hemorrhage in mouselung exposed to the fields of an electrohydraulic lithotripter appear to be less than 2 MPa with as few as 10 pulses and with severe damage occurring at levels between 5 and 6 MPa. This is very much smaller than the fields required to fragment kidney and gallstones and smaller than the thresholds for damage to kidney tissues. Fetal lung, in contrast, did not show signs of damage at 20 MPa. The lower sensitivity of fetal lung is consistent with a cavitation-related mechanism for lung damage by shock waves. Since the pressure in these exposures are almost entirely positive, it suggests that the value of negative pressures as predictors of the behavior of gas bodies in tissues should be reconsidered.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Lung ultrasound is increasingly used in the critically ill adult. It allows prompt management based upon reproducible data and generates fewer computed tomography (CT) examinations, therefore decreasing irradiation, delays, cost, and discomfort to the patient. The aim of this article is to describe the value of ultrasound for lung imaging in the critically ill and state our experience in neonates. METHODS: Review of studies published in the peer-reviewed international literature analyzing consecutive critically ill adults admitted to intensive care units, assessing pleural effusion, alveolar consolidation, interstitial syndrome, and pneumothorax, using a standardized ultrasound approach to the lung, with CT as the reference. DATA SYNTHESIS: The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound are 92{\%} and 93{\%} for pleural effusion, 90{\%} and 98{\%} for alveolar consolidation, 93{\%} and 93{\%} for interstitial syndrome, 100{\%} and 96{\%} for complete pneumothorax, 79{\%} and 100{\%} for radio-occult pneumothorax. DISCUSSION: This article reviews data that validate the scientific value of lung ultrasound in adult medical intensive care units. We then present observations in the critically ill neonate. The discussion points to the methodologic issues raised in lung ultrasound in the neonate, i.e. mainly the limited access to a pertinent gold standard (CT). Some CT correlations are presented, confirming the value of lung ultrasound in the neonate. CONCLUSIONS: The standardized signs assessed in the adult are also found in the critically ill neonate, meaning a potential use in this field. Awaiting confirmatory CT studies, lung ultrasound can be taken into consideration as a possible bedside tool for completing bedside radiography.},

We identified 19 unique suppressors of Dictyostelium G680A and G680V mutants and find that they are structurally and chemically restricted, suggestive of specific, compensatory mechanisms of action. Suppressors cluster in two adjacent elements of the myosin structure, one of which is dominated by substitutions that increase the volume of hydrophobic residues. The suppressors outline a general model for the mechanism of suppression of the G680A and G680V alterations. Secondary phenotypes conferred by suppressors independent of the G680 changes demonstrate that they will be useful substrates for biochemical and genetic characterization.},

abstract = {The strongly non-linear free-surface deformations and inviscid fluid loadings which occur during the constant velocity water entry and exit of a horizontal circular cylinder are here calculated by the numerical method of Vinje and Brevig1. Comparison with the loading predicted by conventional slamming theory (here called added-mass theory) shows fair agreement in some cases. However, a wide and fascinating diversity of free-surface flows is calculated for various starting positions and values of Froude number and this precludes the use of added-mass theory in general. Interesting effects calculated by the numerical scheme are supported by photographs of experiments. For entry these effects include inflow over the top of the cylinder, cavity formation, jet formation and combinations of these. For exit the calculations predict the lifting of the water above the cylinder and subsequent formation of thin layers; the draw-down and rush-up of the free surface beneath the cylinder, the rush-up terminating in localised breaking clearly seen in the experiments; the fluid motion after complete cylinder exit; and, perhaps most interestingly, the formation of large regions of strongly negative pressure on the cylinder surface during late stages of exit which explains the occurrence of the “spontaneous” breaking of the free surface seen in experiments.},

abstract = {Cavitation bubbles accompany explosive vaporization of water following pulsed energy deposition in liquid media. Bubbles collapsing at the tip of a surgical endoprobe produce a powerful and damaging water jet propagating forward in the axial direction of the probe. We studied interaction of such jet with tissue using fast flash photography and modeled the flow dynamics using a two-dimensional Rayleigh-type hydrodynamic simulation. Maximal velocity of the jet generated at pulse energies of up to 1 mJ was about 80 m/s. The jet can produce tissue damage at a distance exceeding the radius of the cavitation bubble by a factor of 4. We demonstrate that formation of this flow and associated tissue damage can be prevented by application of the concave endoprobes that slow down the propagation of the back boundary of the bubble. Similar effect can be achieved by positioning an obstacle to the flow, such as a ring behind the tip.},

Exposure conditions were: 3.1 MHz, 10-s exposure duration, 1-kHz pulse repetition frequency (PRF), and 1.2-/spl mu/s pulse duration. The in situ (at the pleural surface) peak rarefactional pressure ranged between 2.2 and 10.4 MPa with either eight or nine acoustic pressure groups for each of the three pig ages (12 pigs/exposure group) plus sham exposed pigs. There were no lesions in the shams. Pigs were exposed bilaterally with the order of exposure (left then right lung, or right then left lung) and acoustic pressure both randomized. Pig age was not randomized. Individuals involved in animal handling, exposure, and lesion scoring were blinded to the exposure condition. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the dependence of the lesion incidence rates on in situ peak rarefactional pressure, left versus right lung exposure, order of exposure (first versus second), and age in three age groups. Likewise, lesion depth and lesion root surface area were analyzed using Gaussian tobit regression analysis. A significant threshold effect on lesion occurrence was observed as a function of age; younger pigs were less susceptible to lung damage given equivalent in situ exposure. Overall, the oldest pigs had a significantly lower threshold (2.87 /spl plusmn/ 0.29 MPa) than middle-aged pigs (5.83 /spl plusmn/ 0.52 MPa). The oldest pigs also had a lower threshold than neonate pigs (3.60 /spl plusmn/ 0.44 MPa). Also, an unexpected result was observed. The ultrasound exposures were bilateral, and the threshold results reported above were based on the lung that was first exposed. After the first lung was exposed, the pig was turned ove- - r and the other lung was exposed to the same acoustic pressure. There was a significant decrease (greater than the confidence limits) in occurrence thresholds: 3.60 to 2.68, 5.83 to 2.97, and 2.87 to 1.16 MPa for neonates, middle-aged, and oldest pigs, respectively, in the second lung exposed. Thus, a subtle effect in lung physiology resulted in a major effect on lesion thresholds.},

abstract = {The present paper deals with the two-dimensional numerical simulation of gaseous flow and heat transfer in planar microchannel and nanochannel with different wall temperatures in transitional regime 0.1Kn1 . An atomistic molecular simulation method is used known as thermal lattice-Boltzmann method. The results of simulation are presented in four cases corresponding to the Fourier flow, shear-driven flow (Couette flow), pressure-driven flow (Poiseuille flow), and mixed shear-pressure-driven flow in the developing and fully developed regions. The mixed shear-pressure-driven flow is divided into two subcases with shear stress and pressure gradient acting in the same and the opposite directions. Normalized temperature and velocity profiles across the channel, distribution of local wall Nusselt number, and friction coefficient are illustrated. Using this method, nonlinear pressure distribution in the streamwise direction, reduction in mass flow rate, C(f)Re, and Nu by increasing the Knudsen number are studied. It is seen that for Couette flow, Nu over the hotter plate is greater than the cooler plate, but for the pressure-driven flow with stationary wall temperature dependency of viscosity and thermal conductivity causes this trend to be reversed. The reversed flow appearance in the velocity profile is captured in the case of opposite shear-pressure-driven flow.},

abstract = {The limiting influence of the environment on sonar has long been recognised as a major challenge to science and technology. As the area of interest shifts towards the littoral, environmental influences become dominant both in time and space. The manifold challenges encompass prediction, measurement, assessment, and adaptive responses to maximize the effectiveness of systems. Although MCM and ASW activities are dominated in different ways and scales by the environment, both warfare areas have had to consider the significantly changing requirements posed by operations in the littoral. The fundamental scientific issues involved in developing models relating acoustics to the environment are matched in difficulty by the need for data for their validation and eventual practical use for prediction. In many instances the need is for the longer term planning activities.

abstract = {It is customary to describe alveolar respiratory mechanics in terms of a bubble-shaped model alveolus, using the Laplace equation. The coexistence of alveoli of different radii cannot be satisfactorily explained by this model, even if hypotheses as yet unconfirmed by experiment are taken into account. Moreover, this model requires the assumption of extremely low surface tensions, near 0 dny/cm, to explain the absence of atelectasis with very small alveolar radii and the maintenance of alveolar fluid balance. On the basis of investigations of the dynamic surface tension of lung alveolar surfactant from rat lungs, however, the minimal surface tension of alveoli is 18-20 dny/cm. In addition, the lung does not consist of isolated and spherical alveoli but a dense packing of polyhedral air spaces separated by alveolar septa. This paper is an attempt to analyze the recoil forces of the lung due to surface tension on the basis of the polyhedral alveolar structure and the minimum surface tension mentioned above. It is demonstrated that several geometrical parameters are able to guarantee the stability of the alveolar structure of the lung to a greater extent than a variable surface tension. It is concluded that not a single (and fictive) alveolus but the septal intersections and the "peripheral" septa (limiting only one air space) are the smallest morphological units of the respiratory mechanics. Some consequences concerning the pressure-volume behavior of the whole lung, the above mentioned coexistence problem and the alveolar fluid balance are discussed.},

In the context of the new standard Lambda-CDM cosmology we point out confusions regarding the particle horizon, the event horizon, the ``observable universe'' and the Hubble sphere (distance at which recession velocity = c). We show that we can observe galaxies that have, and always have had, recession velocities greater than the speed of light. We explain why this does not violate special relativity and we link these concepts to observational tests. Attempts to restrict recession velocities to less than the speed of light require a special relativistic interpretation of cosmological redshifts. We analyze apparent magnitudes of supernovae and observationally rule out the special relativistic Doppler interpretation of cosmological redshifts at a confidence level of 23 sigma.},

abstract = {In the 1920s, the availability of piezoelectric materials and electronic devices made it possible to produce ultrasound (US) in water at high amplitudes, so that it could be detected after propagation through large distances. Laboratory experiments with this new mechanical form of radiation showed that it was capable of producing an astonishing variety of physical, chemical and biologic effects. In this review, the early findings on bioeffects are discussed, especially those from experiments done in the first few decades, as well as the concepts employed in explaining them. Some recent findings are discussed also, noting how the old and the new are related. In the first few decades, bioeffects research was motivated partly by curiosity, and partly by the wish to increase the effectiveness and ensure the safety of therapeutic US. Beginning in the 1970s, the motivation has come also from the need for safety guidelines relevant to diagnostic US. Instrumentation was developed for measuring acoustic pressure in the fields of pulsed and focused US employed, and standards were established for specifying the fields of commercial equipment. Critical levels of US quantities were determined from laboratory experiments, together with biophysical analysis, for bioeffects produced by thermal and nonthermal mechanisms. These are the basis for safety advice and guidelines recommended or being considered by national, international, professional and governmental organizations. (E-mail: wnyborg@zoo.uvm.edu)},

abstract = {Until the mid 1970s, it was generally assumed that, with the short pulses of ultrasound (US) used in medical diagnosis, there was little need for concern about the possibility of inertial cavitation in vivo. This assumption came into question when experimental evidence indicated that killing of fruit fly larvae by diagnostically relevant US was associated with the presence of gas in the respiratory apparatus of the organisms. Independent theoretical contributions by Flynn and Apfel in the early 1980s made it clear that complacency in regard to cavitation was not warranted. Later, the mammalian lung, as with larva, was shown to be particularly vulnerable when it contained air. Yet, overall evidence suggests that lung hemorrhage is not consistent with the classical picture of inertial cavitation. Most recently, however, hemolysis and hemorrhage associated with the use of contrast agents have provided nearly incontrovertible evidence of the occurrence of cavitation in vivo.},

abstract = {"This volume deals with the interaction of acoustic fields with bubbles in liquids, with emphasis on the principles of cavitation--the generation of bubbles in liquids by rapid changes, such as those introduced by ultrasound. When cavity bubbles implode they produce shock waves in the liquid. If cavitation is induced by turbulent flow, components can be damaged. These phenomena have important implications, particularly in underwater acoustics, one of the fastest growing fields in acoustics research. The Acoustic Bubble skillfully explains the physical processes involved in cavitation both by analogy and formulation, making the concepts accessible to those with a minimal background in mathematics. This book willbe of great interest to those engaged in research in a wide range of areas, from sonochemistry to the sensitization of explosives.},

abstract = {High intensity pulsed ultrasound can produce significant mechanical tissue fractionation with sharp boundaries ("histotripsy"). At a tissue-fluid interface, histotripsy produces clearly demarcated tissue erosion and the erosion efficiency depends on pulse parameters. Acoustic cavitation is believed to be the primary mechanism for the histotripsy process. To investigate the physical basis of the dependence of tissue erosion on pulse parameters, an optical method was used to monitor the effects of pulse parameters on the cavitating bubble cloud generated by histotripsy pulses at a tissue-water interface. The pulse parameters studied include pulse duration, peak rarefactional pressure, and pulse repetition frequency (PRF). Results show that the duration of growth and collapse (collapse cycle) of the bubble cloud increased with increasing pulse duration, peak rarefactional pressure, and PRF when the next pulse arrived after the collapse of the previous bubble cloud. When the PRF was too high such that the next pulse arrived before the collapse of the previous bubble cloud, only a portion of histotripsy pulses could effectively create and collapse the bubble cloud. The collapse cycle of the bubble cloud also increased with increasing gas concentration. These results may explain previous in vitro results on effects of pulse parameters on tissue erosion.},

abstract = {The development of effective passive sonar systems depends upon the ability to accurately predict the performance of sonardetection algorithms in realistic ocean environments. Such environments are typically characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, thus limiting the usefulness of performance prediction approaches that assume a deterministic environment. Here we derive closed-form receiver operating characteristic (ROC) expressions for an optimal Bayesian detector and for several typical suboptimal detectors, based on a statistical model of environmental uncertainty. Various scenarios extended from an NRL benchmark shallow-water model were used to check the analytical ROC expressions and to illustrate the effect of environmental uncertainty on detection performance. The results showed that (1) optimal detection performance in an uncertain environment in diffuse noise depends primarily on the signal-to-noise ratio at the receivers and the rank of the signal matrix, where the rank is an effective representation of the scale of environmental uncertainty; (2) the ROC expression for the optimal Bayesian detector provides a more realistic performance upper bound than that obtained from conventional sonarequations that do not incorporate environmental uncertainty; and (3) detection performance predictions can be performed much faster than with commonly used numerical methods such as Monte Carlo performance evaluations.},

abstract = {Threshold estimates and superthreshold behaviors for US-induced lung hemorrhage were investigated as a function of species (adult mice and rats) and US frequency (2.8 and 5.6 MHz). A total of 151 6-to-7-week-old female ICR mice and 160 10-to-11-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two US frequency groups, and further randomly divided into seven or eight US peak rarefactional pressure groups. Each group consisted of about 10 animals. Animals were exposed to pulsed US at either 2.8-MHz center frequency or 5.6-MHz center frequency for a duration of 10 seconds. The in situ (at the pleural surface) peak rarefactional pressure levels ranged between 2.5 and 10.5 MPa for mice and between 2.3 and 11.3 MPa for rats. The mechanical index (MI) ranged between 1.4 and 6.3 at 2.8 MHz for mice and between 1.1 and 3.1 at 5.6 MHz for rats. The lesion surface area and depth were measured for each animal as well as the percentage of animals with lesions per group. The characteristics of the lesions produced in mice and rats were similar to those described in previous studies, suggesting a common pathogenesis in the initiation and propagation of the lesions at the gross and microscopic levels. The percentage of animals with lesions showed no statistical differences between species or between US frequencies. These findings suggest that mice and rats are similar in sensitivity to US-induced lung damage and that the occurrence of lung damage is independent of frequency. Lesion depth and surface area also showed no statistically significant differences between US frequencies for mice and rats. However, there was a significant difference between species for lesion area and a suggestive difference between species for lesion depth. The superthreshold behavior of lesion area and depth showed that rat lung had more damage than mouse lung, and the threshold estimates shelved a weak, or lack of, frequency dependency, suggesting that the MI is not consistent with the obser- - ved findings.},

The review commences with an outline of early theoretical and experimental investigations into water entry between 1929 and 1959. During this period, the first physical models and mathematical detailing of the problem enabled the calculation of water impact forces. Work on the application of such theories to spacecraft water landing is then reviewed commencing with theoretical and experimental analysis of the first manned spacecraft, followed by further applications including early water impact analysis of the space shuttle solid rocket boosters and water landing characteristics of the orbiter. Following the work on the water landing of spacecraft, more recent developments in the theoretical, experimental and numerical modelling of water impact are reviewed. Recent research on the applications, in particular, numerical modelling techniques, to the water impact crashworthiness of aerospace structures is then reviewed. This part of the review highlights the particular problems encountered with the validation of numerical models. Finally, future directions for research in the field of water entry are discussed including the development and validation of numerical modelling techniques and analysis of the failure of both metallic and composite materials during water impact.},

abstract = {Microfabricated integrated circuits revolutionized computation by vastly reducing the space, labor, and time required for calculations. Microfluidic systems hold similar promise for the large-scale automation of chemistry and biology, suggesting the possibility of numerous experiments performed rapidly and in parallel, while consuming little reagent. While it is too early to tell whether such a vision will be realized, significant progress has been achieved, and various applications of significant scientific and practical interest have been developed. Here a review of the physics of small volumes (nanoliters) of fluids is presented, as parametrized by a series of dimensionless numbers expressing the relative importance of various physical phenomena. Specifically, this review explores the Reynolds number Re, addressing inertial effects; the Peclet number Pe, which concerns convective and diffusive transport; the capillary number Ca expressing the importance of interfacial tension; the Deborah, Weissenberg, and elasticity numbers De, Wi, and El, describing elastic effects due to deformable microstructural elements like polymers; the Grashof and Rayleigh numbers Gr and Ra, describing density-driven flows; and the Knudsen number, describing the importance of noncontinuum molecular effects. Furthermore, the long-range nature of viscous flows and the small device dimensions inherent in microfluidics mean that the influence of boundaries is typically significant. A variety of strategies have been developed to manipulate fluids by exploiting boundary effects; among these are electrokinetic effects, acoustic streaming, and fluid-structure interactions. The goal is to describe the physics behind the rich variety of fluid phenomena occurring on the nanoliter scale using simple scaling arguments, with the hopes of developing an intuitive sense for this occasionally counterintuitive world.},

abstract = {Anesthetized hairless mice were exposed to 1.035 MHz unfocused ultrasound in a temperature-controlled water bath. Visible petechial hemorrhages and hyperemia were produced in the intestines. Histologically, the petechiae appeared to be localized mostly to the lamina propria of the mucosa. For 2 min exposure, the number of petechiae and length of hyperemic tissue both increased with increasing spatial peak pressure amplitude above a threshold of about 0.4-0.57 MPa. The magnitude of these effects increased, and the threshold decreased, with increasing exposure duration from 1 min to 4 min. The effects also increased for increasing bath temperature from 32 degrees C to 42 degrees C. The effects decreased markedly for 1 ms burst-mode exposure with 2 ms and 4 ms repetition periods with constant pressure amplitude, but were essentially constant for constant temporal-average intensity. Both effects were also produced by heating from radio-frequency diathermy at 10.35 MHz. The effects were associated with abdominal temperatures above about 42-43 degrees C, which were estimated with a thermocouple at the end of the exposure. The hyperemia is a clearly thermal effect, while the petechiae have been previously associated with the cavitation mechanism. However, the ultrasonically-induced petechiae observed in this study do not represent an unequivocal marker for cavitation, but rather appear to be attributable to heating. These findings help to reduce the expectation of ultrasonic cavitation during medical therapy treatments.},

A variety of collapse shock pressures were launched into thin liquid sheets either by firing a rectangular projectile or by using an explosive plane-wave generator. The range of these shock pressures was from 0.3 to 3.5GPa. Cavities were found to collapse asymmetrically to produce a high-speed liquid jet which was of ap-proximately constant velocity at low shock pressures. A t high pressures, the jet was found to accelerate and crossed the cavity faster than the collapse-shock traversed the same distance in the liquid. In the final moments of collapse, high temperatures were concentrated in two lobes of trapped gas and light emission was observed from these regions. Other cavity shapes were studied and in the case of cavities with flat rear walls, mult(ip1e jets were observed to form during the collapse.},

Utilizing probabilistic based results from geoacoustic inversions we characterize parameters relevant to sonar performance. This paper describes the estimation of transmission loss and its statistical properties based on posterior parameter probabilities obtained from inversion of ocean acoustic array data. This problem is solved by first finding an ensemble of relevant environmental model parameters and the associated posterior probability using a likelihood based inversion of the acoustic array data. In a second step, each realization of these model parameters is weighted with their posterior probability to map into the transmission loss domain. This approach is illustrated using vertical-array data from a recent benchmark data set and from data acquired during the Asian Seas International Acoustics Experiment (ASIAEX) 2001 in the East China Sea. The environmental parameters are first estimated using a probabilistic-based geoacoustic inversion technique. Based on the posterior probability that each of these environmental models fits the ocean acoustic array data, each model is mapped into transmission loss. This enables us to compute a full probability distribution for the transmission loss at selected frequencies, ranges, and depths, which potentially could be used for sonar performance prediction},

In general, these injuries trigger adaptive responses to either restore homeostasis or to protect the cells from further damage. The ability to restore plasma membrane integrity after injury is critical for cell survival and all cells possess a means to do so. However, the probability of plasma membrane wound repair depends on the cell type, as well as the size and nature of the lesion. Several in vitro experimental models of cell injury have been developed to simulate specific stresses cells experience in vivo. Motivated by our interest in studying the mechanisms of cell injury and repair relevant to ventilator associated lung injury, we review some of the most frequently used in vitro experimental models of cell wounding and present some new data pertaining to alveolar epithelium.},

abstract = {Collagen and elastin are thought to dominate the elasticity of the connective tissue including lung parenchyma. The glycosaminoglycans on the proteoglycans may also play a role because osmolarity of interstitial fluid can alter the repulsive forces on the negatively charged glycosaminoglycans, allowing them to collapse or inflate, which can affect the stretching and folding pattern of the fibers. Hence, we hypothesized that the elasticity of lung tissue arises primarily from 1) the topology of the collagen-elastin network and 2) the mechanical interaction between proteoglycans and fibers. We measured the quasi-static, uniaxial stress-strain curves of lung tissue sheets in hypotonic, normal, and hypertonic solutions. We found that the stress-strain curve was sensitive to osmolarity, but this sensitivity decreased after proteoglycan digestion. Images of immunofluorescently labeled collagen networks showed that the fibers follow the alveolar walls that form a hexagonal-like structure. Despite the large heterogeneity, the aspect ratio of the hexagons at 30{\%} uniaxial strain increased linearly with osmolarity. We developed a two-dimensional hexagonal network model of the alveolar structure incorporating the mechanical properties of the collagen-elastin fibers and their interaction with proteoglycans. The model accounted for the stress-strain curves observed under all experimental conditions. The model also predicted how aspect ratio changed with osmolarity and strain, which allowed us to estimate the Young's modulus of a single alveolar wall and a collagen fiber. We therefore identify a novel and important role for the proteoglycans: they stabilize the collagen-elastin network of connective tissues and contribute to lung elasticity and alveolar stability at low to medium lung volumes.},

abstract = {As the international hydrographic community continues to address the question of irreducible uncertainty in modern surveys, a similar question must be asked of archived vertical beam echosounder (VBES) and leadline data sets. The Office of Naval Research funded STRATAFORM project surveyed an area of the New Jersey shelf around 39deg12' N 72deg50' W using an EM1000 multibeam echosounder (MBES). This area is also covered by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration surveys from 1936 to 1938 (from early visual indicating fathometers) and 1975-1976 (VBES). The analysis shows that the earlier data are biased in deeper water, most probably because of "hydrographic rounding" or instrument limitations, and may be unrecoverable, but that the VBES data appear approximately unbiased. Estimates of uncertainty for a surface model generated from the archive data are constructed, taking into account measurement, interpolation, and hydrographic uncertainty (addressing the problems of unobserved areas and surface reconstruction stability). Comparison of predicted depths against the MBES data shows that the VBES-derived surface is consistent given the quoted uncertainty and that the uncertainty corresponds with appropriate hydrographic survey standards. However, spatial aliasing of the VBES surface is observed, which may be the limiting factor in the applicability of this data},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the elasticity of various tissues and report it in kilopascals.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The thyroid, submandibular, and parotid glands, masseter and gastrocnemius muscles, supraspinatus and Achilles tendons, renal cortex and pelvis, pancreas, and spleen of 127 healthy volunteers (89 women, 38 men; mean age, 37.72 ± 9.11 years; range, 17-63 years) were evaluated with shear-wave ultrasound elastography.

RESULTS: The mean elasticity values were determined to be 10.97 ± 3.1 kPa for the thyroid, 10.92 ± 3.1 kPa for the submandibular glands, 10.38 ± 3.5 kPa for the parotid glands, 10.4 ± 3.7 kPa for the masseter muscle, 11.1 ± 4.1 kPa for the gastrocnemius muscle, 31.2 ± 13 kPa for the supraspinatus muscle, 51.5 ± 25.1 kPa for the Achilles tendons, 5.0 ± 2.9 kPa for the renal cortex, 23.6 ± 5.4 kPa for the renal pelvis, 4.8 ± 3 kPa for the pancreas, and 2.9 ± 1.8 kPa for the spleen.

CONCLUSION: Elasticity values were determined for different tissues with shear-wave ultrasound elastography. Further studies comparing the elasticity values of normal and pathologic tissues are necessary to determine the diagnostic role of this technique.},

The Lagrangian treatment allows the air/water interface to be tracked throughout the interaction. The incident shock is partially transmitted into the cavity, within which it experiences multiple reflections. The upstream cavity wall involutes to form a high-speed jet which, on impact with the far cavity wall, produces an intense blast wave. Heating of the gas within the cavity is highly non-isentropic, and is dominated by shock heating. The predicted final gas temperature is of order 12000 K, although the modelling assumptions used here lead to over-prediction of temperature during the later stages of collapse.},

abstract = {Thermal injury, a potential mechanism of ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage, was studied by comparing lesions induced by an infrared laser (a tissue-heating source) with those induced by pulsed ultrasound. A 600-mW continuous-wave CO2 laser (wavelength ???10.6 ??m) was focused (680-??m beamwidth) on the surface of the lungs of rats for a duration between 10 to 40 s; ultrasound beamwidths were between 310 and 930 ??m. After exposure, lungs were examined grossly and then processed for microscopic evaluation. Grossly, lesions induced by laser were somewhat similar to those induced by ultrasound; however, microscopically, they were dissimilar. Grossly, lesions were oval, red to dark red and extended into subjacent tissue to form a cone. The surface was elevated, but the center of the laser-induced lesions was often depressed. Microscopically, the laser-induced injury consisted of coagulation of tissue, cells and fluids, whereas injury induced by ultrasound consisted solely of alveolar hemorrhage. These results suggest that ultrasound-induced lung injury is most likely not caused by a thermal mechanism.

Diagnostic ultrasound scanners were used for exposure at 3.2, 5.0 and 7.4 MHz, and previously published data at 1.5 and 2.5 MHz was also included. A laboratory exposure system was used to simulate DUS exposure at 1.0, 1.5, 2.25, 3.5, 5.0 and 7.5 MHz, with higher peak rarefactional pressure amplitudes (PRPAs) than were available from our DUS systems. The right kidneys of rats mounted in a water bath were exposed to intermittent image pulse sequences at 1 s intervals during infusion of diluted ultrasound contrast agent. The percentage of GCH was zero for low PRPAs, and then rapidly increased with increasing PRPAs above an apparent threshold, pt. The values of pt were approximately proportional to the ultrasound frequency, f, such that pt /f was approximately 0.5 MPa/MHz for DUS and 0.6 MPa/MHz for laboratory system exposures. The increasing thresholds with increasing frequency limited the GCH effect for contrast-aided DUS, and no GCH was seen for DUS at 5.0 or 7.4 MHz for the highest available PRPAs.

abstract = {This thesis concerns the dynamics of bubbly flows with a distribution of equilibrium bubble sizes. The main goal is to formulate the physical and numerical models of continuum bubbly flows that enable us to efficiently compute the average mixture dynamics. Numerical simulations are conducted to quantify the effects of bubble size distributions on the averaged dynamics for several model flows.

First, the ensemble-averaged conservation laws for polydisperse bubbly flows are derived. One-way-coupled flow computations are conducted to illustrate that the different-sized bubbles can oscillate with different frequencies. The resulting phase cancellations can be regarded as an apparent damping of the averaged dynamics of polydisperse flows. A high-order-accurate finite-volume method is then developed to compute the flow, paying special attention to issues of wave dispersion and stiffness.

Next, computations of one-dimensional shock propagation through bubbly liquids are performed. The numerical experiments reveal that the bubble size distribution has a profound impact on the averaged shock structure. If the distribution is sufficiently broad, the apparent damping due to the phase cancellations can dominate over the single-bubble-dynamic dissipation (due to thermal, viscous, and compressibility effects) and the averaged shock dynamics become insensitive to the individual bubble dynamics. One-dimensional cloud cavitation caused by fluid-structure interaction is also solved to investigate the collapse of cavitation clouds with both monodisperse and polydisperse nuclei. The phase cancellations among the cavitation bubbles with broad nuclei size distributions are found to eliminate violent cloud collapse in the averaged dynamics.

Finally, shock propagation through a bubbly liquid-filled, deformable tube is considered. The quasi-one-dimensional conservation law that takes into account structural deformation is formulated and steady shock relations are derived. The results are compared to water-hammer experiments; the present shock theory gives better agreement with the measured wave speeds than linear theory. This indicates that the gas-phase nonlinearity needs to be included to accurately predict the propagation speeds of finite-amplitude waves in a deformable tube filled with a bubbly liquid.},

abstract = {In animal experiments, the pathogenesis of lung hemorrhage due to exposure to clinical diagnostic levels of ultrasound has been attributed to an inertial cavitation mechanism. The purpose of this article is to report the results of two experiments that directly contradict the hypothesis that ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage is caused by inertial cavitation. Elevated hydrostatic pressure was used to suppress the involvement of inertial cavitation. In experiment one, 160 adult mice were equally divided into two hydrostatic pressure groups (0.1 or 1.1 MPa), and were randomly exposed to pulsed ultrasound (2.8-MHz center frequency, 1-kHz PRF, 1.42-micros pulse duration, 10-s exposure duration). For the two hydrostatic pressure groups (80 mice each), 8 in situ peak rarefactional pressure levels were used that ranged between 2.82 and 11.8 MPa (10 mice/group). No effect of hydrostatic pressure on the probability of hemorrhage was observed. These data lead to the conclusion that lung hemorrhage is not caused by inertial cavitation. Also, the higher hydrostatic pressure enhanced rather than inhibited the impact of ultrasonic pressure on the severity (hemorrhage area, depth, and volume) of lesions. These counterintuitive findings were confirmed in a second experiment using a 2 x 5 factorial design that consisted of two ultrasonic pressure levels and five hydrostatic pressure levels (100 mice, 10 mice/group). If inertial cavitation were the mechanism responsible for lung hemorrhage, then elevated hydrostatic pressures should have resulted in less rather than more tissue damage at each ultrasonic pressure level. This further supports the conclusion that the pathogenesis of ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage is not caused by inertial cavitation.},

A quantitative study was conducted to analyze the academic and demographic characteristics of newly admitted, matriculated degree-seeking students (N = 640) from Fall 2002 to Fall 2004 in the Master's of Business Administration and Master's in Communication Sciences and Disorders at a national research university in the southeastern United States. Demographic variables analyzed were age, gender, and ethnicity. Academic variables analyzed were program delivery mode, undergraduate grade point average, graduate grade point average at time of dropout or completion, admission test scores, and number of terms to degree completion or number of courses completed at time of dropout. Results of the study found that online students were significantly more likely to dropout than campus based students. Age was found to have a significant unique affect on dropout in both programs with older students more likely to dropout. Academic and demographic variables were not found to be significantly associated with dropout in the online formats of either program. Variables related to dropout for the campus based groups of both programs differed. Campus MBA students who dropped out were older and had higher GMAT scores while campus CSDI students who dropped out had lower undergraduate GPA's and GRE scores. Logistic regression analyses showed age and delivery format to have significant unique effects beyond other predictors on dropout in the MBA program overall while age and undergraduate GPA had significant unique effects beyond other predictors on dropout for the CSDI program.},

abstract = {In order to predict bioeffects in contrast-enhanced diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound procedures, the dynamics of cavitation microbubbles in viscoelastic media must be determined. For this theoretical study, measured 1.5 to 7.5 MHz pulse pressure waveforms, which were used in experimental determinations of capillary breaching thresholds for contrast-enhanced diagnostic ultrasound in a rat kidney, were used to calculate cavitation nucleated from contrast agent microbubbles. A numerical model for cavitation in tissue was developed based on the Keller-Miksis equation (a compressible extension of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation for spherical bubble dynamics), with a Kelvin-Voigt constitutive relation. From this model, the bubble dynamics corresponding to the experimentally obtained capillary breaching thresholds were determined. Values of the maximum radius and temperature corresponding to previously determined bioeffect thresholds were computed for a range of ultrasound pulses and bubble sizes for comparison to inertial cavitation threshold criteria. The results were dependent on frequency, the gas contents, and the tissue elastic properties. The bioeffects thresholds were above previously determined inertial cavitation thresholds, even for the tissue models, suggesting the possibility of a more complex dosimetry for capillary injury in tissue.},

abstract = {Those concerned with acoustic cavitation often use different measures and nomenclature to those who employ ultrasound for medical purposes. After illustrating the connections between the two, acoustic cavitation phenomena are divided into two classes: (1) relatively moderate amplitude changes in the bubble size that occur during each acoustic cycle, as with rectified diffusion and resonant bubble motion, and (2) rather dramatic changes in the bubble radius that occur in one cycle. It is seen that pulse-echo diagnostic equipment can excite the dramatic changes whereas continuous wave therapeutic equipment will excite the slower, but no less important, changes. The ranges of the acoustic variables and material states for which these phenomena are possible are quantified. It is shown that whereas the concept of an ultrasonic (energy) dose may be appropriate for the effects of acoustically induced heating or resonant bubble motion. It is inappropriate when discussing the effects of the transient type of cavitation that can occur from short, high amplitude acoustic pulses.},

abstract = {Matched-field methods concern estimation of source locations and/or ocean environmental parameters by exploiting full wave modeling of acoustic waveguide propagation. Typical estimation performance demonstrates two fundamental limitations. First, sidelobe ambiguities dominate the estimation at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to a threshold performance behavior. Second, most matched-field algorithms show a strong sensitivity to environmental/system mismatch, introducing biased estimates at high SNR. In this paper, some theoretical developments on matched-field performance analysis are summarized, including Bayesian performance bounds and probabilistic ambiguity analysis, both incorporating environmental/system uncertainty/mismatch. Performance analysis is then implemented for source localization in a typical shallow water environment chosen from the Shallow Water Evaluation Cell Experiments (SWellEX). The performance predictions describe the simulations of the maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) well, including the mean-square error (MSE) in all SNR regions as well as the bias at high SNR. The threshold SNR and bias predictions are also validated through SWellEX experimental data processing. The results suggest the current environmental, acoustic, and statistical modeling has developed to such a level that the optimum theoretical matched-field performance can be achieved in a well-controlled experiment},

abstract = {Collagen and elastin are thought to dominate the elasticity of the connective tissue including lung parenchyma. The glycosaminoglycans on the proteoglycans may also play a role because osmolarity of interstitial fluid can alter the repulsive forces on the negatively charged glycosaminoglycans, allowing them to collapse or inflate, which can affect the stretching and folding pattern of the fibers. Hence, we hypothesized that the elasticity of lung tissue arises primarily from 1) the topology of the collagen-elastin network and 2) the mechanical interaction between proteoglycans and fibers. We measured the quasi-static, uniaxial stress-strain curves of lung tissue sheets in hypotonic, normal, and hypertonic solutions. We found that the stress-strain curve was sensitive to osmolarity, but this sensitivity decreased after proteoglycan digestion. Images of immunofluorescently labeled collagen networks showed that the fibers follow the alveolar walls that form a hexagonal-like structure. Despite the large heterogeneity, the aspect ratio of the hexagons at 30{\%} uniaxial strain increased linearly with osmolarity. We developed a two-dimensional hexagonal network model of the alveolar structure incorporating the mechanical properties of the collagen-elastin fibers and their interaction with proteoglycans. The model accounted for the stress-strain curves observed under all experimental conditions. The model also predicted how aspect ratio changed with osmolarity and strain, which allowed us to estimate the Young's modulus of a single alveolar wall and a collagen fiber. We therefore identify a novel and important role for the proteoglycans: they stabilize the collagen-elastin network of connective tissues and contribute to lung elasticity and alveolar stability at low to medium lung volumes.},

Now, very radical surgical procedures are less often necessary, because early diagnosis and smaller tumors are more common, and because radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been shown to be as or more effective than extensive surgical resections for many large cancers. Therefore, surgeons can select treatment options that maximize quality of life without increasing the risk of treatment failure. Older patients respond to surgical cancer treatment in much the same way as younger adults, and can benefit greatly from this flexible therapeutic approach. Solid tumors for which treatment options are discussed in this paper include cancer of the breast, rectum, prostate, oral cavity, melanoma, and soft tissue sarcoma.},

Thus pair-fed broods produced significantly more fledglings than female-fed broods. Feeding and non-feeding males attracted equal numbers of mates, on average, and their time budgets did not differ significantly, but feeding males tended to be older and more experienced than non-feeding males, and their territories had significantly higher insect emergence than those of non-feeding males. Feeding males produced on average two more young per year than non-feeding males. Feeding males did not feed all of their broods, but generally fed the first brood that hatched on their territories. These pair-fed broods were significantly larger than broods fed only by females paired with feeding males. In addition, pair-fed broods tended to be associated with the oldest females. Thus male parental in- vestment appears to be advantageous, and males appear to be investing in the broods with the highest reproductive value.},

abstract = {This study investigated the phenomenon of ultrasonically induced lung hemorrhage in humans. Multiple experimental laboratories have shown that diagnostic ultrasound exposure can cause hemorrhage in the lungs of laboratory animals. The left lung of 50 patients (6 women, 44 men, mean age 61 years) was observed directly by the surgeon after routine intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was performed. From manufacturer specifications the maximum derated intensity in the sound field of the system used was 186 W/cm2, the maximum derated rarefactional acoustic pressure was 2.4 MPa, and the maximum mechanical index was 1.3. The lowest frequency used was 3.5 MHz. This exposure exceeds the threshold found for surface lung hemorrhage seen on gross observation of laboratory animals. No hemorrhage was noted on any lung surface by the surgeon on gross observation. We conclude that clinical transesophageal echocardiography, even at field levels a little greater than the reported thresholds for lung hemorrhage in laboratory animals, did not cause surface lung hemorrhage apparent on gross observation. These negative results support the conclusion that the human lung is not markedly more sensitive to ultrasound exposure than that of other mammals. (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 1998;11:57-60.)},

In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Effects of the baroclinic torque on wave propagation normally neglected under the Boussinesq approximation is investigated here, with a special focus on the associated consequences for the mechanistic interpretation of shear instability arising from the interaction between a pair of vorticity-propagating waves. To illustrate and elucidate the physical effects that modify wave propagation, we consider three examples of increasing complexity: wave propagation supported by a uniform background flow;
wave propagation supported on a piecewise-linear basic state possessing one jump; and an instability problem of a piecewise-linear basic state possessing two jumps, which supports the possibility of shear instability. We find that the non-Boussinesq effects introduce a preference for the direction of wave propagation that depends on the sign of the shear in the region where waves are supported. This in turn affects phase-locking of waves that is crucial for the mechanistic interpretation for shear instability, and is seen here to have an inherent tendency for stabilisation.},

abstract = {Non-Newtonian properties on bubble dynamics and cavitation are fundamentally different from those of Newtonian fluids. The most significant effect arises from the dramatic increase in viscosity of polymer solutions in an extensional flow, such as that generated about a spherical bubble during its growth or collapse phase. In addition, many biological fluids, such as blood, synovial fluid, and saliva, have non-Newtonian properties and can display significant viscoelastic behaviour. This monograph elucidates general aspects of bubble dynamics and cavitation in non-Newtonian fluids and applies them to the fields of biomedicine and bioengineering. In addition it presents many examples from the process industries. The field is strongly interdisciplinary and the numerous disciplines involve have and will continue to overlook and reinvent each others' work. This book helps researchers to think intuitively about the diverse physics of these systems, to attempt to bridge the various communities involved, and to convey the interest, elegance, and variety of physical phenomena that manifest themselves on the micrometer and microsecond scales.

abstract = {The acoustic radiation pressure has found practical application in recent years in instruments measuring sound intensity and in experiments on acoustic levitation. The concept of radiation pressure has, however, long fascinated both optical and acoustical physicists. The history of light radiation pressure goes back more than 200 years to Leonhard Euler, while the concept of acoustic radiation pressure dates from the time and work of Rayleigh. It was pointed out by Brillouin that what we call radiation pressure is not a pressure at all, but a diagonal tensor, all the diagonal terms of which are not identical. The size of the effect is small, and the values obtained for the radiation pressure are very sensitive to boundary conditions and to the approximations that must necessarily be employed. In addition, although the phenomenon is primarily one of nonlinear acoustics, it can be observed down to the lowest sound intensities under certain conditions. Thus, the Rayleigh radiation pressure vanishes for the linear case, but the usually measured Langevin pressure does not. It might be said that radiation pressure is a phenomenon that the observer thinks he understands--for short intervals, and only every now and then},

For this theoretical study, measured 1.5 to 7.5 MHz pulse pressure waveforms, which were used in experimental determinations of capillary breaching thresholds for contrast-enhanced diagnostic ultrasound in a rat kidney, were used to calculate cavitation nucleated from contrast agent microbubbles. A numerical model for cavitation in tissue was developed based on the Keller-Miksis equation (a compressible extension of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation for spherical bubble dynamics), with a Kelvin-Voigt constitutive relation. From this model, the bubble dynamics corresponding to the experimentally obtained capillary breaching thresholds were determined. Values of the maximum radius and temperature corresponding to previously determined bioeffect thresholds were computed for a range of ultrasound pulses and bubble sizes for comparison to inertial cavitation threshold criteria. The results were dependent on frequency, the gas contents, and the tissue elastic properties. The bioeffects thresholds were above previously determined inertial cavitation thresholds, even for the tissue models, suggesting the possibility of a more complex dosimetry for capillary injury in tissue.},

abstract = {Although the Discontinuous Galerkin (dg) method has seen widespread use for compressible flow problems in a single fluid with constant material properties, it has yet to be implemented in a consistent fashion for compressible multiphase flows with shocks and interfaces. Specifically, it is challenging to design a scheme that meets the following requirements: conservation, high-order accuracy in smooth regions and non-oscillatory behavior at discontinuities (in particular, material interfaces). Following the interface-capturing approach of Abgrall [1], we model flows of multiple fluid components or phases using a single equation of state with variable material properties; discontinuities in these properties correspond to interfaces. To represent compressible phenomena in solids, liquids, and gases, we present our analysis for equations of state belonging to the Mie–Gr{\"{u}}neisen family. Within the dg framework, we propose a conservative, high-order accurate, and non-oscillatory limiting procedure, verified with simple multifluid and multiphase problems. We show analytically that two key elements are required to prevent spurious pressure oscillations at interfaces and maintain conservation: (i) the transport equation(s) describing the material properties must be solved in a non-conservative weak form, and (ii) the suitable variables must be limited (density, momentum, pressure, and appropriate properties entering the equation of state), coupled with a consistent reconstruction of the energy. Further, we introduce a physics-based discontinuity sensor to apply limiting in a solution-adaptive fashion. We verify this approach with one- and two-dimensional problems with shocks and interfaces, including high pressure and density ratios, for fluids obeying different equations of state to illustrate the robustness and versatility of the method. The algorithm is implemented on parallel graphics processing units (gpu) to achieve high speedup.},

abstract = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers {\&} results.},

abstract = {The impedance difference for a water-air interface yields virtually complete reflection for ultrasound, which coincidentally delivers an acoustical radiation surface pressure (ARSP). ARSP may be a physical mechanism for pulmonary capillary hemorrhage induced by diagnostic ultrasound. Fundamental tissue parameters in biomedical acoustics are the density $\rho$, speed of sound c, and the resulting acoustical impedance z=$\rho$c. Many tissues are similar to water (z = 1,628 krayl), but not lung. The gas content of lung imparts an extreme heterogeneity with air having z = 0.424 krayl. If the lung surface is modeled simply as a water-air interface, then the ARSP is maximal. During a diagnostic ultrasound pulse, ARSP can be comparable to the pulmonary capillary blood pressure, thus adding stress to capillaries. However, the bulk properties of the lung are different from air. One of the few reports on acoustical properties of lung was by Floyd Dunn (JASA 1986;80:1248). Consideration of these bulk properties of lung tissue...},

abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) is considered as one of the major problems in the 21st century posed to human beings as a result of urbanization and industrialization of human civilization. The large amount of heat generated from urban structures, as they consume and re-radiate solar radiations, and from the anthropogenic heat sources are the main causes of UHI. The two heat sources increase the temperatures of an urban area as compared to its surroundings, which is known as Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII). The problem is even worse in cities or metropolises with large population and extensive economic activities. The estimated three billion people living in the urban areas in the world are directly exposed to the problem, which will be increased significantly in the near future. Due to the severity of the problem, vast research effort has been dedicated and a wide range of literature is available for the subject. The literature available in this area includes the latest research approaches, concepts, methodologies, latest investigation tools and mitigation measures. This study was carried out to review and summarize this research area through an investigation of the most important feature of UHI. It was concluded that the heat re-radiated by the urban structures plays the most important role which should be investigated in details to study urban heating especially the UHI. It was also concluded that the future research should be focused on design and planning parameters for reducing the effects of urban heat island and ultimately living in a better environment. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

Chapter 2 discusses the nucleation of cavitation and basic fluid dynamics, while Chapter 3 draws together the acoustics and bubble dynamics to discuss the free oscillation of a bubble and acoustic emissions from such activity. The acoustic probes that are often applied to study the behavior of a bubble when an externally-applied acoustic field drives it into oscillation is deliberated in Chapter 4. The last chapter outlines a variety of effects associated with acoustically-induced bubble activity. The bubble detection, sonoluminescence, sonochemistry, and pulse enhancement are also covered.This publication is a good reference for physics and engineering students and researchers intending to acquire knowledge of the acoustic interactions of acoustic fields with bubbles.},

abstract = {Experimental investigations have not fully explored the interaction between ultrasound beams and microbubble contrast agents. Moreover theoretical investigations have not solved the problem of the microbubble oscillation. A simple in-vitro system based on a commercial scanner (ATL UM9) was used to insonate (3 MHz transmission) diluted contrast suspensions of Definity and Quantison at different acoustic pressures (0.27-1.52 MPa). The experimental data were referred to a blood mimicking fluid in order to extract an estimate of their scattering cross-section. The results were compared with the solutions of the three main bubble oscillatidn models, Rayleigh-Plesset, Herring and Gilmore. Non-linear solutions of the above models were produced numerically using the Mathematica Package Software. The experiments showed that both agents provided a linear increase in scattering cross-section with increasing acoustic pressure. The thick shelled Quantison provided an increasing number of scatterers with increasing acoustic pressure, which proved that free bubbles leaked out of the shell. At high acoustic pressures both Quantison and Definity scattering cross-sections were almost identical, and were probably that of a free bubble. The Rayleigh-Plesset model provided a scattering cross-section almost independent of acoustic pressure. On the contrary the scattering cross-sections calculated by the Herring and Gilmore models solutions displayed a definite dependence on acoustic pressure of an order higher than one, which is slightly higher than the order of dependence exhibited by the experimental data. However, the increase of the experimentally measured scattering cross-section with acoustic pressure was sharper than the calculated one by the above two models. This is most probably due to the fact that the models simulated damped and not free bubble oscillations. In conclusion the Rayleigh-Plesset model was inadequate in describing the bubble oscillations even at small diagnostic acoustic pressures. The Herring and Gilmore models could simulate the dependence of the scattering cross-section of encapsulated microbubbles on acoustic pressure. However the contribution of free bubble oscillations has still to be modelled.},

abstract = {Human beings have never been able to live without emotional support and material help either singly or in groups. This fact becomes more obvious as we look around the world today. Everybody wants to be loved, cared for, and to experience the essence of relationships of one kind and another. The midwife's opportunity to give this support is clearly seen, as she is the closest person to the mother, baby and family as a whole, and at the time when her help is needed. Her positive attitude towards breast-feeding can help to create the socially supportive situation which is important to the mother, father, baby and the family as a whole. The midwife may begin to get across her ideas long before parenthood becomes a reality. She needs to be a part of the community, and close liaison with the following groups would help to give the right start to promote the necessary material and emotional support: youth leaders of the community; church groups; schools; clubs and sports centres; the male sector of the community; organizers of advertisements, e.g. public transport, television and news media; medical/nursing/paramedical colleagues; and the community as a whole. After that preparatory phase, the intermediate phase needs to be considered: during the pre-natal period, as much support as well as adequate instructions must be given. In the final phase, after delivery, the encouragement previously given affords the chance for breast-feeding to start in the delivery room. During post-natal life, the support continues for as long as possible. Weaning will follow, any time from four months to one year. We must remember the fringe benefits of breast-feeding: natural family planning; emotional comfort; nursing experience between the mother and the baby; and, finally, breast milk is the perfect food.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic biophysics is the study of mechanisms responsible for how ultrasound and biological materials interact. Ultrasound-induced bioeffect or risk studies focus on issues related to the effects of ultrasound on biological materials. On the other hand, when biological materials affect the ultrasonic wave, this can be viewed as the basis for diagnostic ultrasound. Thus, an understanding of the interaction of ultrasound with tissue provides the scientific basis for image production and risk assessment. Relative to the bioeffect or risk studies, that is, the biophysical mechanisms by which ultrasound affects biological materials, ultrasound-induced bioeffects are generally separated into thermal and non-thermal mechanisms. Ultrasonic dosimetry is concerned with the quantitative determination of ultrasonic energy interaction with biological materials. Whenever ultrasonic energy is propagated into an attenuating material such as tissue, the amplitude of the wave decreases with distance. This attenuation is due to either absorption or scattering. Absorption is a mechanism that represents that portion of ultrasonic wave that is converted into heat, and scattering can be thought of as that portion of the wave, which changes direction. Because the medium can absorb energy to produce heat, a temperature rise may occur as long as the rate of heat production is greater than the rate of heat removal. Current interest with thermally mediated ultrasound-induced bioeffects has focused on the thermal isoeffect concept. The non-thermal mechanism that has received the most attention is acoustically generated cavitation wherein ultrasonic energy by cavitation bubbles is concentrated. Acoustic cavitation, in a broad sense, refers to ultrasonically induced bubble activity occurring in a biological material that contains pre-existing gaseous inclusions. Cavitation-related mechanisms include radiation force, microstreaming, shock waves, free radicals, microjets and strain. It is more challenging to deduce the causes of mechanical effects in tissues that do not contain gas bodies. These ultrasonic biophysics mechanisms will be discussed in the context of diagnostic ultrasound exposure risk concerns. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Atomization and fountain formation is a well-known phenomenon that occurs when a focused ultrasound wave in liquid encounters an air interface. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been shown to fractionate a tissue into submicron-sized fragments in a process termed boiling histotripsy, wherein the focused ultrasound wave superheats the tissue at the focus, producing a millimetre-sized boiling or vapour bubble in several milliseconds. Yet the question of how this millimetre-sized boiling bubble creates submicron-sized tissue fragments remains. The hypothesis of this work is that the tissue can behave as a liquid such that it atomizes and forms a fountain within the vapour bubble produced in boiling histotripsy. We describe an experiment, in which a 2 MHz HIFU transducer (maximum in situ intensity of 24 000 W cm(-2)) was aligned with an air-tissue interface meant to simulate the boiling bubble. Atomization and fountain formation was observed with high-speed photography and resulted in tissue erosion. Histological examination of the atomized tissue showed whole and fragmented cells and nuclei. Air-liquid interfaces were also filmed. Our conclusion was that HIFU can fountain and atomize tissue. Although this process does not entirely mimic what was observed in liquids, it does explain many aspects of tissue fractionation in boiling histotripsy.},

abstract = {In the mammalian lung, alveolar gas and blood are separated by an extremely thin membrane, despite the fact that mechanical failure could be catastrophic for gas exchange. We raised the pulmonary capillary pressure in anesthetized rabbits until stress failure occurred. At capillary transmural pressures greater than or equal to 40 mmHg, disruption of the capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium was seen in some locations. The three principal forces acting on the capillary wall were analyzed. 1) Circumferential wall tension caused by the transmural pressure. This is approximately 25 dyn/cm (25 mN/m) at failure where the radius of curvature of the capillary is 5 microns. This tension is small, being comparable with the tension in the alveolar wall associated with lung elastic recoil. 2) Surface tension of the alveolar lining layer. This contributes support to the capillaries that bulge into the alveolar spaces at these high pressures. When protein leakage into the alveolar spaces occurs because of stress failure, the increase in surface tension caused by surfactant inhibition could be a powerful force preventing further failure. 3) Tension of the tissue elements in the alveolar wall associated with lung inflation. This may be negligible at normal lung volumes but considerable at high volumes. Whereas circumferential wall tension is low, capillary wall stress at failure is very high at approximately 8 x 10(5) dyn/cm2 (8 x 10(4) N/m2) where the thickness is only 0.3 microns. This is approximately the same as the wall stress of the normal aorta, which is predominantly composed of collagen and elastin. The strength of the thin part of the capillary wall is probably attributable to the collagen IV of the basement membranes. The safety factor is apparently small when the capillary pressure is raised during heavy exercise. Stress failure causes increased permeability with protein leakage, or frank hemorrhage, and probably has a role in several types of lung disease.},

Mice were exposed to 10 us impulses at 1.6 MPa for 3 min and sacrificed either immediately or 5 min following exposure. When observed with both light and transmission electron microscopy, there was no gradation in lung injury, with a sharp demarcation of the hemorrhagic area. Moreover, both type I pneumocytes and capillary endothelial cells were injured, causing direct continuities between vessel lumina and alveolar spaces. In the absence of extravasation, the tissue appeared normal. There was no evidence that injury increased in severity during the first 5 min after exposure.},

conditions were: 3.1 MHz, 10-s exposure duration, 1-kHz PRF, and

rarefactional pressure ranged between 2.2 and 10.4 MPa with either 8 or
9 acoustic pressure groups for each of the three pig ages (12
pigs/exposure group) plus sham exposed pigs; there were no lesions in
the shams. Pigs were exposed bilaterally with the order of exposure
(left and right lung) and acoustic pressure both randomized. Logistic
regression analysis was used to examine the dependence of the lesion
incidence rates on in situ peak rarefactional pressure, left versus
right lung, order of exposure (first versus second) and age in three
categories. Likewise, lesion depth and root surface area were analyzed
using Gaussian to bit regression analysis. A significant threshold
effect on lesion occurrence was observed as a function of age; younger
pigs were less susceptible to lung damage given equivalent in situ
exposure},

@article{Miller1996,
abstract = {This selective review of the biological effects of ultrasound presents a synopsis of our current understanding of how cells insonated in vitro are affected by inertial cavitation from the standpoint of physical and chemical mechanisms. The focus of this review is on the physical and chemical mechanisms of action of inertial cavitation which appear to be effective in causing biological effects. There are several fundamental conditions which must be satisfied before cavitation-related bioeffects may arise. First, bubbles must be created and then brought into proximity to cells. Exposure methods are critical in this regard, and simple procedures such as rotation of a vessel containing the cells during exposure can drastically alter the results. Second, once association is achieved between bubbles and cells, the former must interact with the latter to produce a bioeffect. It is not certain that the inertial event is the prime mechanism by which cells are lysed; there is evidence that the turbulence associated with bubble translation may cause lysis. Additionally, there appear to be chemical and other physical mechanisms by which inertial cavitation may affect cells; these include the generation of biologically effective sonochemicals and the apparent emission of ultraviolet (UV) and soft X-rays. The evidence for inertial cavitation occurring within cells is critically reviewed.},

abstract = {Acoustic transmission loss (TL) and supporting ocean environmental data collected during the Asian Seas International Acoustics Experiment (ASIAEX) on June 3, 2001, in the East China Sea (ECS), in a water depth of approximately 100 m are presented. Objectives of the data analysis are to explore the stochastic nature of TL in terms of the mean (mu TL) and the fluctuations around the mean (as described by the standard deviation (sigmaTL) and higher order statistics). In particular, we conjecture that muTL robustly reflects the macrostate of the ocean, including the bottom, whereas uncertainties in TL as measured by sigmaTL are related to the microstate of the ocean, again including the bottom. Comparisons are made to TL data at a similar location, 200 km from the ASIAEX site, in waters of the same depth, by the Harsh Environment Program in September 1997. The TL is shown to be approximately horizontally isotropic with exception to a discrete anisotropic feature likely caused by internal waves. Various mechanisms of uncertainty are discussed to describe the microstate. These were not sufficiently resolved to identify the primary cause of variability},

abstract = {Superthreshold behavior for ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage was investigated in adult mice and rats at an ultrasound center frequency of 2.8 MHz to assess the role of pulse repetition frequency and exposure duration. One hundred fifty, 6–7-week-old female ICR mice and 150 10–11-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were each divided into 15 exposure groups (10 animals per group) for a 3 × 5 factorial design (3 exposure durations of 5, 10, and 20 s and 5 pulse repetition frequencies of 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 Hz). The in situ (at the pleural surface) peak rarefactional pressure of 12.3 MPa and the pulse duration of 1.42 $\mu$s were the same for all ultrasonically-exposed animals. In addition, 15 sham exposed mice and 15 sham exposed rats were included into both studies. In each study of 165 animals, the exposure conditions were randomized. The lesion depth and surface area were measured for each animal, as well as the percentage of animals with lesions per group. The characteristics of the lesions produced in mice and rats were similar to those described in studies by our research group and others, suggesting a common pathogenesis for the initiation and propagation of the lesions at the gross and microscopic levels. The proportion of lesions in both species was related statistically to pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and exposure duration (ED), with the exception that PRF in rats was not quite significant; the PRF × ED interaction (number of pulses) for lesion production was not significant for either species. The PRF, but not ED, significantly affected lesion depth in both species; the PRF × ED interaction for depth was not significant for either species. Both PRF and ED significantly affected lesion surface area in mice, while neither affected area in rats; the PRF × ED interaction for surface area was not significant for either species.

abstract = {The numerical simulation of the deformation of an inviscid fluid–fluid interface subjected to an axisymmetric impulse in pressure is considered. Using a boundary integral formulation, the interface is evolved for a range of upper-fluid and lower-fluid density ratios under the influence of inertial, interfacial and gravitational forces. The interface is seen to evolve into axisymmetric waves or droplets depending upon the density ratio, level of surface tension and gravity. Moreover, the droplets may be spherical, tear shaped or elongated. These conclusions are expressed in a phase diagram of inverse Weber number We−1 versus Atwood number At at zero gravity, i.e. with the Froude number Fr−1→0, and complement the earlier findings of Tjan {\&} Phillips, who present a phase diagram of We−1 versus Fr−1 for the case in which the upper fluid has zero density. They too report tear-shaped droplets; however, while, in their paper, they form as a result of gravity, those reported here form as a result of surface tension. It is also found that the pinch-off process which effects drops remains of the power-law type with exponent 2/3 irrespective of the presence of gravity and an upper fluid. However, the constant Graphic that relates the necking radius to the time from pinch off, which is universal in the absence of gravity and an upper fluid, is affected by the presence gravity, an upper fluid and the class of drops which form.},

abstract = {Studies with the mouse have shown that lung hemorrhage can result from exposure to ultrasound at a peak pressure of ∼1 MPa at 4 MHz (Mechanical Index [MI] ∼0.5). In order to determine whether a comparable outcome could occur in a larger animal with characteristics similar to humans, studies were performed with monkeys using a clinical scanner under maximum output conditions (imaging + pulsed and color Doppler; derated pr of 3.7 MPa [4.5 MPa, measured in water], 4 MHz; MI ∼ 1.8) (N = 57). Monkeys ranged in age from 1 day of life to 16 years with exposures limited to the right lung lobes (5 min cranial, 5 min caudal; N = 41 exposed, N = 12 sham-exposed controls, N = 4 colony controls). Results showed that animals ranging in age from 3 months to 5 years (mean age of 2.5 years) had a greater propensity for the occurrence of multiple well-demarcated circular hemorrhagic foci (0.1–1.0 cm), which were not observed in either control group. These lesions were characterized by marked congestion of alveolar capillaries with accumulation of red blood cells within the alveolar spaces, and were unassociated with major vessels or respiratory bronchioles. Further studies will be required in order to determine the relevance of these findings to the human, although it was concluded that ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage in the monkey is of a significantly lesser degree when compared to the mouse.},

abstract = {We generally think of bubbles as benign and harmless and yet they can manifest the most remarkable range of physical effects. Some of those effects are the stuff of our everyday experience as in the tinkling of a brook or the sounds of breaking waves at the beach. But even these mundane effects are examples of the ability of bubbles to gather, focus and radiate energy (acoustic energy in the above examples). In other contexts that focusing of energy can lead to serious technological problems as when cavitation bubbles eat great holes through ships' propeller blades or cause a threat to the integrity of the spillways at the Hoover Dam. In liquid-propelled rocket engines, bubbles pose a danger to the stability of the propulsion system, and in artificial heart valves they can cause serious damage to the red blood cells. In perhaps the most extraordinary example of energy focusing, collapsing cavitation bubbles can emit not only sound, but also light with black body radiation temperatures equal to that of the sun (Brennen 1995 Cavitation and bubble dynamics). But, harnessed carefully, this almost unique ability to focus energy can also be put to remarkably constructive use. Cavitation bubbles are now used in a remarkable range of surgical and medical procedures, for example to emulsify tissue (most commonly in cataract surgery or in lithotripsy procedures for the reduction of kidney and gall stones) or to manipulate the DNA in individual cells. By creating cavitation bubbles non-invasively thereby depositing and focusing energy non-intrusively, one can generate minute incisions or target cancer cells. This paper will begin by briefly reviewing the history of cavitation phenomena and will end with a vision of the new horizons for the amazing cavitation bubble.},

abstract = {Chest physical examination often includes performing chest percussion, which involves introducing sound stimulus to the chest wall and detecting an audible change. This approach relies on observations that underlying acoustic transmission, coupling, and resonance patterns can be altered by chest structure changes due to pathologies. More accurate detection and quantification of these acoustic alterations may provide further useful diagnostic information. To elucidate the physical processes involved, a realistic computer model of sound transmission in the chest is helpful. In the present study, a computational model was developed and validated by comparing its predictions with results from animal and human experiments which involved applying acoustic excitation to the anterior chest, while detecting skin vibrations at the posterior chest. To investigate the effect of pathology on sound transmission, the computational model was used to simulate the effects of pneumothorax on sounds introduced at the anterior chest and detected at the posterior. Model predictions and experimental results showed similar trends. The model also predicted wave patterns inside the chest, which may be used to assess results of elastography measurements. Future animal and human tests may expand the predictive power of the model to include acoustic behavior for a wider range of pulmonary conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Our aim was to observe ultrasound-induced intravascular microbubble destruction in vivo and to characterize any resultant bioeffects. METHODS AND RESULTS Intravital microscopy was used to visualize the spinotrapezius muscle in 15 rats during ultrasound delivery. Microbubble destruction during ultrasound exposure caused rupture of {\textless} or = 7-microm microvessels (mostly capillaries) and the production of nonviable cells in adjacent tissue. The number of microvessels ruptured and cells damaged correlated linearly (P{\textless}0.001) with the amount of ultrasound energy delivered. CONCLUSIONS Microbubbles can be destroyed by ultrasound, resulting in a bioeffect that could be used for local drug delivery, angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling, or for tumor destruction.},

abstract = {The nonlinear oscillations of a spherical, acoustically forced gas bubble in nonlinear viscoelastic media are examined. The constitutive equation [Upper-Convective Maxwell (UCM)] used for the fluid is suitable for study of large-amplitude excursions of the bubble, in contrast to the previous work of the authors which focused on the smaller amplitude oscillations within a linear viscoelastic fluid [J. S. Allen and R. A. Roy, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 107, 3167-3178 (2000)]. Assumptions concerning the trace of the stress tensor are addressed in light of the incorporation of viscoelastic constitutive equations into bubble dynamics equations. The numerical method used to solve the governing system of equations (one integrodifferential equation and two partial differential equations) is outlined. An energy balance relation is used to monitor the accuracy of the calculations and the formulation is compared with the previously developed linear viscoelastic model. Results are found to agree in the limit of small deformations; however, significant divergence for larger radial oscillations is noted. Furthermore, the inherent limitations of the linear viscoelastic approach are explored in light of the more complete nonlinear formulation. The relevance and importance of this approach to biomedical ultrasound applications are highlighted. Preliminary results indicate that tissue viscoelasticity may be an important consideration for the risk assessment of potential cavitation bioeffects.},

abstract = {We present a model applicable to ultrasound contrast agent bubbles that takes into account the physical properties of a lipid monolayer coating on a gas microbubble. Three parameters describe the properties of the shell: a buckling radius, the compressibility of the shell, and a break-up shell tension. The model presents an original non-linear behavior at large amplitude oscillations, termed compression-only, induced by the buckling of the lipid monolayer. This prediction is validated by experimental recordings with the high-speed camera Brandaris 128, operated at several millions of frames per second. The effect of aging, or the resultant of repeated acoustic pressure pulses on bubbles, is predicted by the model. It corrects a flaw in the shell elasticity term previously used in the dynamical equation for coated bubbles. The break-up is modeled by a critical shell tension above which gas is directly exposed to water.},

Here we model the cell as a viscoelastic Maxwell material bounded by constant surface tension and simulate indentation experiments to quantify the effects of (N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP)-stimulation on its mechanical properties (elastic shear modulus and viscosity). We then simulate neutrophil transit through individual pulmonary capillary segments to determine the relative effects of capillary geometry and fMLP-stimulation on transit time. Indentation results indicate that neutrophil viscosity and shear modulus increase by factors of 3.4, for 10(-9) M fMLP, and 7.3, for 10(-6) M fMLP, over nonstimulated cell values, determined to be 30.8 Pa.s and 185 Pa, respectively. Capillary flow results indicate that capillary entrance radius of curvature has a significant effect on cell transit time, in addition to minimum capillary radius and neutrophil stimulation level. The relative effects of capillary geometry and fMLP on neutrophil transit time are presented as a simple dimensionless expression and their physiological significance is discussed.},

abstract = {To study the physical properties of renal tubular basement membranes directly, the epithelial layer of single isolated perfused rabbit proximal convoluted, proximal straight, and cortical collecting tubules was removed with sodium desoxycholate. Tubular segments were perfused using micropipets. The distal end of each segment was occluded in order to simplify the measurement of transmembrane water flow. The relation between outer tubular diameter and applied transmural pressure was identical in intact tubules and their respective isolated tubular basement membranes indicating that the basement membrane determines tubular distensibility. Young's modulus for basement membranes from all tubular segments corresponded to that of tendon collagen. Membrane hydraulic conductivity was measured in two ways: (a) from the rate of transmural flow in response to an applied difference in hydrostatic pressure and, (b) from the rate of transmural flow in response to a difference in colloid osmotic pressure. The hydraulic conductivity of tubular basement membranes was 300-800 times greater than that of the intact epithelial layer. Basement membrane hydraulic conductance was similar to that of peritubular and glomerular capillaries in vivo. The hydrostatic conductance of tubular basement membranes exceeded the osmotic conductance by 3-10-fold owing largely to the fact that the membranes were moderately permeable to the osmotic solute (albumin). In view of these findings we suggest that oncotic and hydrostatic pressure may play an important role in the movement of tubular absorbate from the epithelial compartment into the renal interstitium.},

abstract = {The pulmonary alveolus, terminal gas-exchange unit of the lung, is composed of alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells separated by a thin basement membrane and interstitial space. These cells participate in the maintenance of a delicate system regulated not only by biological factors but also by the mechanical environment of the lung, which undergoes dynamic deformation during breathing. Clinical and animal studies as well as cell culture studies point toward a strong influence of mechanical forces on lung cells and tissues including effects on growth and repair, surfactant release, injury, and inflammation. However, despite substantial advances in our understanding of lung mechanics over the last half century, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the micromechanics of the alveolus and how it deforms during lung inflation. Therefore, the aims of this review are to draw a multidisciplinary account of the mechanics of the alveolus on the basis of its structure, biology, and chemistry and to compare estimates of alveolar deformation from previous studies.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

@article{West1992,
abstract = {The pathogenesis of high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is disputed. We propose that the mechanism is stress failure of pulmonary capillaries. The main features to be accounted for are the strong association with pulmonary hypertension, the high permeability characteristics of the edema, and the presence of inflammatory markers in the lung lavage fluid. When the capillary pressure is raised to about 40 mmHg in anesthetized rabbits, ultrastructural damage to the capillary walls is seen including breaks in the capillary endothelial layer, alveolar epithelial layer, and sometimes all layers of the wall. This results in a high permeability form of edema with the escape of high molecular weight proteins and blood cells into the alveolar spaces. In addition the basement membrane of the endothelial layer is frequently exposed, and we suggest that this highly reactive surface attracts and activates platelets and neutrophils. The result is the formation of small thrombi which are frequently seen in HAPE, and the presence of inflammatory markers such as leukotriene B4 and the complement fragment C5a in the lung lavage fluid. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction raises the pressure in some capillaries because the constriction is uneven. Since HAPE has its origin in the high pulmonary artery pressure, the objective of treatment should be to reduce the pressure by descent, administering oxygen, or giving drugs such as calcium channel blockers (e.g. nifedipine) which relax pulmonary vasoconstriction. Stress failure of pulmonary capillaries satisfactorily accounts for the features of HAPE.},

abstract = {The pulmonary blood-gas barrier is an extraordinary bioengineering structure because of its vast area but extreme thinness. Despite this, almost no attention has been given to its mechanical properties. The remarkable area and thinness come about because gas exchange occurs by passive diffusion. However, the barrier also needs to be immensely strong to withstand the very high stresses in the capillary wall when capillary pressure rises during exercise. The strength of the thin region of the barrier comes from type IV collagen in the basement membranes. When the stresses in the capillary walls rise to high levels, ultrastructural changes occur in the barrier, a condition known as stress failure. Physiological conditions that alter the properties of the barrier include severe exercise in elite human athletes. Animals that have been selectively bred for high aerobic activity, such as Thoroughbred racehorses, consistently break their pulmonary capillaries during galloping. Pathophysiological conditions causing stress failure include high-altitude pulmonary edema and overinflation of the lung, which frequently occurs with mechanical ventilation. Remodeling of the capillary wall occurs in response to increased wall stress in diseases such as mitral stenosis. The barrier is able to maintain its extreme thickness with sufficient strength as a result of continual regulation of its wall structure. How it does this is a central problem in lung biology.},

A range of frequencies is used to study the bubble behavior in terms of its growth and collapse shapes, and the maximum jet velocity attained. Simulation results show complex dynamic behaviors of the bubble. In several cases a jet is formed directed away from the bio-material while in others, toward it. In certain cases, the bubble eventually breaks into two, with or without the formation of opposite penetrating jets. Very high maximum velocities of jets directing away or toward the bio-materials can be observed in some cases (700 to 900 ms(-1)).},

The image showed rapid initiation and progression of comet tail artifacts across the lung image for an on-screen mechanical index (MI) of 0.9, which corresponded to a pulmonary hemorrhage in the lung. Groups of rats were scanned at a range of MI settings and a threshold was located at an MI of about 0.44. This finding indicated a greater sensitivity to pulmonary ultrasound than was expected, based on previous results. Further research is needed to understand this phenomenon and to develop safety guidelines for sonographers.},

abstract = {This study characterized the reparative responses in rat lung. Forty-five adult female rats were exposed at two sites over the left lung to 3.1-MHz superthreshold pulsed ultrasound. The repair of lung lesions was evaluated from 0 through 44 days postexposure. Macroscopic lesions at 0 days postexposure were large bright red ellipses of hemorrhage. By 1 and 3 days postexposure, lesions were the same size and dark red to red-black, but, by 3 days postexposure, lesions had a raised surface appearance. From 5 to 10 days postexposure, lesions grew smaller in size, progressed from red-gray to yellow-brown, and retained a raised surface appearance. From 13 through 44 days postexposure, lesions gradually decreased in size, had a faint yellow-brown discoloration, and gradually lost the raised surface appearance. By 37 and 44 days postexposure, lung returned to near normal morphology, but had small areas of light yellow-brown discoloration in the areas where lung was exposed. Microscopic lesions at 0 and 1 days postexposure were areas of acute alveolar hemorrhage. By 3 days postexposure, lesions had loss of alveolar erythrocytes and the formation of hemoglobin crystals. From 5 through 44 days postexposure, iron in degraded erythrocytes was processed to hemosiderin and was negligible in quantity at 44 days postexposure. The proliferation of resident cells (likely alveolar epithelial cells, fibroblasts and endothelial cells) and the infiltration of inflammatory cells in lesions declined in intensity as the lesions aged and was minimal by 44 days postexposure. Under the superthreshold exposure conditions described, lesions induced by ultrasound do not seem to have long-term residual effects in lung. (E-mail: zacharyj@staff.uiuc.edu)},

At these frequencies the viscosities are orders of magnitude less than those reported at 0.5–5 kHz by Oestreicher (1951). The low impedances (viscosities) correspond to low velocities and extremely high absorption coefficients for shear waves in tissue. Subject Classification: [43]80.20, [43]80.30.},

In this study, the roles of PRF and PD were evaluated at 5.9 MPa, the peak rarefactional pressure threshold near that of the ED50 estimate previously determined. Methods. A 4 x 4 factorial design study (PRF: 50, 170, 500, and 1700 Hz; PD: 1.3, 4.4, 8.2, and 11.6 {\{}micro{\}}s) was conducted (2.8 MHz; 10-s ED). Sprague Dawley rats (n = 175) were divided into 16 exposure groups (10 rats per group) and 1 sham group (15 rats); no lesions were produced in the sham group. Logistic regression analysis evaluated significance of effects for lesion occurrence, and Gaussian tobit analysis evaluated significance for lesion depth and surface area. Results. For lesion occurrence and sizes, the main effect of PRF was not significant. The interaction term, PRF x PD, was highly significant, indicating a strong positive dependence of lesion occurrence on the duty factor. The main effect of PD was almost significant (P = .052) and thus was included in the analysis model for a better fit. Conclusions. Compared with the findings from a PRF x ED factorial study ( J Ultrasound Med 2005; 24:339-348 ), a function that considers PRF, PD, and ED might yield a sensitive indicator for consideration of a modified mechanical index, at least for the lung.},

abstract = {Although the pulmonary capillaries were discovered in 1661, the ultrastructure of the wall was not elucidated until 60 years ago. Electron micrographs then showed that only 0.2 $\mu$m of tissue separated the capillary endothelium from the alveolar space over much of the area. In retrospect this vanishingly small protective layer should have alerted physiologists to the potential fragility of the capillaries, but this was not appreciated until almost 40 years later. This predicament is unique to pulmonary capillaries. No other capillaries in the body are shielded from the outside environment by such a minute amount of tissue. Reasons why the fragility of the capillaries was not recognized earlier include an inappropriate comparison with the properties of systemic capillaries, the mistaken view that the pulmonary capillary pressure is always low, and a misleading use of the Laplace equation. Evidence for the fragility comes from physiological, pathological, and laboratory observations. As expected from evolutionary considerations, the fragility only becomes evident in the normal lung under exceptional conditions. These include elite human athletes at maximal exercise and animals that have developed the capacity for extreme aerobic activity. However, lung and heart diseases frequently cause capillary disruption. Remodeling of pulmonary capillaries occurs in humans in whom the capillary pressure rises over a long period. Neonatal capillaries are extremely fragile, presumably because they have never been exposed to increased transmural pressures. The capillaries conform to the general biological rule that tissue adapts its structure to carry out its required function.},

abstract = {Objective. The purpose of this study was to augment and reevaluate the ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage findings of a previous 5 × 3 factorial design study (Ultrasound Med Biol 2001; 27:267-277) that evaluated the role of pulse repetition frequency (PRF: 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 Hz) and exposure duration (ED; 5, 10, and 20 s) on ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage at an in situ (at the pleural surface) peak rarefactional pressure [p r(in situ)] of 12.3 MPa; only PRF was found to be significant. However, saturation (response plateau) due to the high pr(in situ) might have skewed the results. In this follow-up 3 × 3 factorial design study, a wider range of PRFs and EDs were used at a lower p r(in situ). Methods. Sprague Dawley rats (n = 198) were divided into 18 ultrasonically exposed groups (10 rats per group) and 6 sham groups (3 per group). The 3 × 3 factorial design study (PRF: 17, 170, and 1700 Hz; ED: 5, 31.6, and 200 s) was conducted at 2 frequencies (2.8 and 5.6 MHz). The p r(in situ) was 6.1 MPa. Logistic regression analysis evaluated lesion occurrence, and Gaussian tobit analysis evaluated lesion depth and surface area. Results. Frequency did not have a significant effect, so the analysis combined results for the 2 frequencies. For lesion occurrence and sizes, the main effects for PRF and ED were not significant. The interaction term was highly significant, indicating a strong dependence of lesion occurrence and size on the total number of pulses (PRF × ED). Conclusions. The results of both studies are consistent with the hypothesis that the total number of pulses is an important factor in the genesis of ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess cardiopulmonary function in rats exposed to pulsed ultrasound using superthreshold exposure conditions known to produce significant lung hemorrhage. METHODS: In 1 group of 9 anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats, 5 foci of ultrasound-induced hemorrhage were produced in the left lung of each rat. In a second group of 6 rats, 5 foci of ultrasound-induced hemorrhage were produced in the left and right lungs of each rat. Each lesion was induced using superthreshold pulsed ultrasound exposure conditions (3.1-MHz center frequency, 1.7-kHz pulse repetition frequency, 1.3-micro-second pulse duration, 60-second exposure duration, 39-MPa in situ peak compressional pressure, and 17-MPa in situ peak rarefactional pressure). After exposure, the lungs were fixed in formalin and assessed histologically. The total lesion volume was calculated for each lesion in each lung lobe. Measurements of cardiopulmonary function included assessment of pulsatile arterial pressure, heart rate, end-tidal carbon dioxide, respiratory rate, and arterial blood gases (PCO2 and PO2). Functional data were quantified before (baseline) and 30 minutes after exposure to ultrasound. RESULTS: In the 9 rats that had lesions in only the left lung, the mean (SEM) lesion volume was 97 (13) mm3 and represented about 3.4{\%} of the total lung volume. In the 6 rats that had lesions in both the left and right lungs, the left, right, and total mean lesion volumes, respectively, were 102 (16), 114 (11), and 216 (18) mm3 and represented about 3.7{\%}, 4.2{\%}, and 7.9{\%} of the total lung volume. There were no statistically significant differences in cardiopulmonary measurements between baseline values and values obtained after exposure to ultrasound in the 9 rats exposed on the left lung only. The 6 rats exposed bilaterally had statistically significant differences in arterial pressure (134 +/- 4 versus 113 +/- 9 mm Hg; P= .047) and arterial PO2 (70 +/- 5 versus 58 +/- 4 mm Hg; P = .024) between baseline values and values obtained after exposure to ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of ultrasound-induced lesions produced in 1 lung did not affect measurements of cardiopulmonary function because of the functional respiratory reserve in the unexposed lung. However, when both the left and right lungs had ultrasound-induced lesions, the functional respiratory reserve was decreased to a point at which rats were unable to maintain systemic arterial pressure or resting levels of arterial PO2.},

abstract = {Routine pulmonary ultrasound for diagnosis of disease or injury relies on interpretation of image features, such as comet-tail artifacts, which can also be indicative of the poorly understood phenomenon of ultrasound-induced pulmonary capillary hemorrhage (PCH). Evans blue extraction and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were evaluated for assessment of PCH induced by ultrasound scanning. Rats anesthetized with ketamine with or without xylazine received sham or scanning for 5 min with a 7.6 MHz linear array. Evans blue extraction and BAL albumin measurements failed to demonstrate significant increases for scanning, even though the induction of comet-tail artifacts was significant. BAL cell counts had an insignificant increase relative to shams at a near-threshold mechanical index (MI) of 0.52 (P=0.07), but a highly significant increase at MI=0.9 (P=0.001). The possibility of xylazine-induced elevated albumin was tested, but no significant decrease was found for sham or scanned rats with ketamine-only anesthesia. Interestingly, without xylazine, the widths of comet-tail artifacts in the ultrasound images were significantly smaller (P=0.001) and cell counts in BAL fluid also were reduced (P=0.014). The BAL cell-count method provides a valuable additional means of PCH quantification.},

abstract = {Interactions between acoustic waves and liquid-gas interfaces occur in a variety of applications, including diagnostic ultrasound of the lung. We hypothesize that, because of the sharp density gradient at the fluid discontinuity, acoustic waves may generate sufficient baroclinic vorticity to appreciably deform liquid-gas interfaces. This nonlinear effect has been studied for shock-accelerated interfaces, i.e., the Rictmyer-Meshkov instability; however, it is not describable through traditional, linear acoustic methods and is not well studied for acoustic waves. To investigate our hypothesis, we simulate an inviscid, compressible fluid system with acoustic waves impinging from water into air. We find that acoustic waves capable of deforming the interface during the wave-interface interaction period will deposit lasting baroclinic vorticity along the interface, capable of driving deformation that continues long after the passage of the wave.

abstract = {A reliable knowledge of the thickness of the alveolo-capillary "membrane" or air-blood barrier is of physiologic interest since it is intimately related to a quantitative estimation of such functional events as gas diffusion or tissue metabolism in the lung. The characteristic thickness of the air-blood barrier with respect to gas diffusion is its harmonic mean thickness, while the arithmetic mean thickness is related to the mass of tissue building the barrier and consuming oxygen in the lung. Two morphometric methods are proposed by which these two dimensions can be estimated from random measurements in the electron microscope in a reliable, simple, and efficient manner. By applying these methods to three rat lungs the arithmetic mean thickness of the barrier was found to measure 1.25 micro, the harmonic mean thickness, 0.57 micro. On the basis of these measurements a geometric model of the barrier in the form of a corrugated membrane was derived. Its dimensions showed close similarity to those of the natural barrier. This analysis suggested furthermore that the gas conductance of the barrier is nearly optimal if one considers the mass of tissue and the minimal barrier thickness as fixed properties which are determined by other functional requirements on the alveolo-capillary membrane.},

abstract = {The evolution of an unbounded inviscid free surface subjected to a velocity potential of Gaussian form and also to the influence of inertial, interfacial and gravitational forces is considered. This construct was motivated by the occurrence of lung haemorrhage resulting from ultrasonic imaging and pursues the notion that bursts of ultrasound act to expel droplets that puncture the soft air-filled sacs in the lung plural surface, allowing them to fill with blood. The tissue adjacent to the sacs is modelled as a liquid and the air–tissue interface in the sacs as a free surface. The evolution of the free surface is described by a boundary-integral formulation and, since the free surface evolves slowly relative to the bursts of ultrasound, they are realized as an impulse at the free surface, represented by the velocity potential. As the free surface evolves, it is seen to form axisymmetric surface jets, waves or droplets, depending upon the levels of gravity and surface tension. Moreover the droplets may be spherical and ejected away from the surface or an inverted tear shape and fall back to the surface. These conclusions are expressed in a phase diagram of inverse Froude number Fr−1 versus inverse Weber number We−1. Specifically, while axisymmetric surface jets form in the absence of surface tension and gravity, gravity acts to bound their height, rendering them waves, although instability overrides the calculation prior to its reaching that bound. Surface tension acts to suppress the instability (provided that We−1 {\textgreater} 0.045) and to form drops; if sufficiently strong it can also damp the evolving wave, causing it to collapse. The pinchoff which effects spherical drops is of power-law type with exponent 2/3, and the universal constant that relates the necking radius to the time from pinchoff, thereby realizing a finite-time singularity, has the value {\$}{\{}\backslashmathfrak{\{}K{\}}{\}} \backslash,{\{}={\}}\backslash, 0.45 \backslashpm 0.025{\$}. Finally, drops can occur once the mechanical index, a dimensional measure used in ultrasonography, exceeds 0.5.},

abstract = {Threshold pressures for hemorrhage in mouse lung exposed to the fields of an electrohydraulic lithotripter appear to be less than 2 MPa with as few as 10 pulses and with severe damage occurring at levels between 5 and 6 MPa. This is very much smaller than the fields required to fragment kidney and gallstones and smaller than the thresholds for damage to kidney tissues. Fetal lung, in contrast, did not show signs of damage at 20 MPa. The lower sensitivity of fetal lung is consistent with a cavitation-related mechanism for lung damage by shock waves. Since the pressures in these exposures are almost entirely positive, it suggests that the value of negative pressures as predictors of the behavior of gas bodies in tissues should be reconsidered. ?? 1990.},

@article{West1999,
abstract = {The pulmonary blood-gas barrier needs to satisfy two conflicting requirements. It must be extremely thin for efficient gas exchange, but also immensely strong to withstand the extremely high stresses in the capillary wall when capillary pressure rises during exercise. The strength of the blood-gas barrier on the thin side is attributable to the type IV collagen in the basement membranes. However, when the wall stresses rise to very high levels, ultrastructural changes in the barrier occur, a condition known as stress failure. Physiological conditions that alter the properties of the barrier include intense exercise in elite human athletes. Some animals, such as Thoroughbred racehorses, consistently break their alveolar capillaries during galloping, causing hemorrhage. Pathophysiological conditions causing stress failure include neurogenic pulmonary edema, high-altitude pulmonary edema, left heart failure, and overinflation of the lung. Remodeling of the capillary wall occurs in response to increased wall stress, a good example being the thickening of the capillary basement membrane in diseases such as mitral stenosis. The blood-gas barrier is able to maintain its extreme thinness with sufficient strength only through continual regulation of its wall structure. Recent experimental work suggests that rapid changes in gene expression for extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors occur in response to increases in capillary wall stress. How the blood-gas barrier is regulated to be extremely thin but sufficiently strong is a central issue in lung biology.},

abstract = {When strong shocks interact with transverse density gradients, it is well known that vorticity deposition occurs. When two non-planar blast waves interact, a strong shock will propagate through the internal structure of each blast wave where the shock encounters such density gradients. There is therefore the potential for the resulting vorticity to produce pronounced density structures long after the passage of these shocks. If the two blast waves have evolved to the self-similar (Sedov) phase this is not a likely prospect, but for blast waves at a relatively early stage of their evolution this remains possible. We show, using 2D numerical simulations, that the interactions of two ‘marginally young' blast waves can lead to strong vorticity deposition which leads to the generation of a strong protrusion and vortex ring as mass is driven into the internal structure of the weaker blast wave.},

abstract = {Exposure conditions were determined for hind limb paralysis and lung hemorrhage of neonatal mice due to pulsed exposure (10$\mu$s pulse duration) to 1 MHz focused ultrasound. Spatial peak pulse average intensity and peak rarefactional pressure levels for paralysis in 50{\%} of specimens sonicated were determined for pulse repetition frequencies of 1, 5 and 50 kHz at 10°C and 2.4 s exposure duration. The results suggest that cavitation was involved in the paralysis at a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 50 kHz, but that cavitation took place in the coupling medium and probably not within the specimen during exposures at a PRF of 5 kHz. The results show an inverse relation between spatial peak pulse average intensity, or peak rarefactional pressure and sound on-time. Exposure conditions for lung hemorrhage were determined for a pulse duration of 10 $\mu$s at 10°C and exposure durations of 2.4 and 180 s. The results show that the threshold exposure conditions for lung hemorrhage are much less than the conditions for cavitational or other effects reported for tissues that do not contain well defined gas bodies. In addition, the results show an inverse relation between exposure level and either exposure duration or sound on-time, suggesting that time is an important parameter associated with bubble effects.},

@article{Brennen2015,
abstract = {We generally think of bubbles as benign and harmless and yet they can manifest the most remarkable range of physical effects. Some of those effects are the stuff of our everyday experience as in the tinkling of a brook or the sounds of breaking waves at the beach. But even these mundane effects are examples of the ability of bubbles to gather, focus and radiate energy (acoustic energy in the above examples). In other contexts that focusing of energy can lead to serious technological problems as when cavitation bubbles eat great holes through ships' propeller blades or cause a threat to the integrity of the spillways at the Hoover Dam. In liquid-propelled rocket engines, bubbles pose a danger to the stability of the propulsion system, and in artificial heart valves they can cause serious damage to the red blood cells. In perhaps the most extraordinary example of energy focusing, collapsing cavitation bubbles can emit not only sound, but also light with black body radiation temperatures equal to that of the sun (Brennen 1995 Cavitation and bubble dynamics). But, harnessed carefully, this almost unique ability to focus energy can also be put to remarkably constructive use. Cavitation bubbles are now used in a remarkable range of surgical and medical procedures, for example to emulsify tissue (most commonly in cataract surgery or in lithotripsy procedures for the reduction of kidney and gall stones) or to manipulate the DNA in individual cells. By creating cavitation bubbles non-invasively thereby depositing and focusing energy non-intrusively, one can generate minute incisions or target cancer cells. This paper will begin by briefly reviewing the history of cavitation phenomena and will end with a vision of the new horizons for the amazing cavitation bubble.},

abstract = {Measurements of low-frequency sound propagation over the areas of the Australian continental shelf, where the bottom sediments consist primarily of calcarenite, have revealed that acoustic transmission losses are generally much higher than those observed over other continental shelves and remain relatively low only in a few narrow frequency bands. This paper considers this phenomenon and provides a physical interpretation in terms of normal modes in shallow water over a layered elastic seabed with a shear wave speed comparable to but lower than the water-column sound speed. A theoretical analysis and numerical modeling show that, in such environments, low attenuation of underwater sound is expected only in narrow frequency bands just above the modal critical frequencies which in turn are governed primarily by the water depth and compressional wave speed in the seabed. In addition, the effect of a thin layer of harder cap-rock overlaying less consolidated sediments is considered. Low-frequency transmission loss data collected from an offshore seismic survey in Bass Strait on the southern Australian continental shelf are analyzed and shown to be in broad agreement with the numerical predictions based on the theoretical analysis and modeling using an elastic parabolic equation solution for range-dependent bathymetry.},

abstract = {In this paper, the results from a series of rheological tests of fresh pig kidney have been reported. Using a standard strain-controlled rheometer, the oscillation strain sweep experiment showed a linear viscoelastic strain limit of the order of 0.2{\%} strain. To determine the components of dynamic moduli in terms of frequency, shear oscillation tests were done at strain 0.2{\%} using a stress-controlled rheometer. Shear stress relaxation tests were carried out with a fixed strain of 0.2{\%} and 0.02 s rise time. The model we have developed uses a multi-mode upper convected Maxwell ({\{}UCM){\}} model with variable viscosities and time constants, to which we have added a Mooney hyper-elastic response, both multiplied by a damping function. Different forms of damping functions that controll the non-linearity of stress-strain profile have been tested. The model was fitted to our experimental data, and matched the entire test data resonably well with a single set of parameters.},

The free and forced periodic solutions are computed numerically. For large bubbles, such as underwater explosion bubbles, the free oscillations agree with those obtained by Keller and Kolodner. For small bubbles, such as cavitation bubbles, with small or intermediate forcing amplitudes, the results agree with those calculated by Lauterborn from the modified Rayleigh equation of Plesset e t a l.

Improvements to analytical and numerical models have led to critical insights into cavity formation, the depth and time of pinch-off, forces, and trajectories for myriad different impact parameters. This topic spans a wide range of regimes, from low-speed entry phenomena dominated by surface tension to high-speed ballistics, for which cavitation is important.

abstract = {Historical hydrographic data are used to determine the spatial and seasonal patterns of uncertainty in thermohaline and sound-speed fields in a well-sampled region, the continental shelf and slope in the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB). Several different historical databases are combined to produce two-dimensional (2-D) plan view and cross-shelf fields of temperature, salinity, and sound speed in two separate regions, the New England shelf and the shelf off Delaware and Maryland. In addition, spatial maps of the sound-speed fields reveal that the maximum variance of the sound speed occurs at the edge of the continental shelf, in the vicinity of the shelfbreak front. The standard deviation of the sound speed was largest during the spring and summer, with magnitudes as large as 14 m/s in a narrow band coinciding with the mean position of the shelfbreak front. During spring the peak in variance was located near the surface outcrop of the front, but during summer the maximum variance was centered at a depth of 30 m, immediately beneath the seasonal thermocline. Comparisons with both synoptic measurements from the Shelfbreak PRIMER experiment as well as moored time series from the Nantucket Shoals Flux Experiment confirm that the shelfbreak front is a "hotspot" of uncertainty (maximum variance), and that the vertical structure of the peak variance is dependent on the presence or absence of the seasonal thermocline},

abstract = {Several animal models have exhibited petechial hemorrhage in the lung within the current FDA output limit of diagnostic ultrasound systems. To elucidate the mechanism of damage, seven rat lungs were simultaneously exposed or sham exposed in vivo to 6‐MHz pulsed Doppler ultrasound and interrogated with a confocally aligned 30‐MHz active cavitation detector (ACD) [R. A. Roy, S. Madanshetty, and R. E. Apfel, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 20, 2451–2455 (1990)]. The right lung lobes of four 200 g rats were insonified with an ATL HDI 3000 6.0‐MHz Doppler pulse for 1.5 min and three rats were sham exposed. At the termination of ultrasound or sham exposure, each animal was immediately euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg IP) and lung tissues were removed intact, inflated with buffered formalin, and examined by a pathologist who was blind to the exposure conditions. Histologically, damage was observed in the lungs exposed to ultrasound as extravasation of erythrocytes into the alveolar spaces. The ACD signal received was analyzed for the presence of increased scattering and radiated noise from inertial cavitation. The variance of the sequentially obtained ACD received pulses correlated with the damage in the exposed lungs. We conclude that inertial cavitation mediated the damage from diagnostic ultrasound.

abstract = {Recent studies indicated that lung tissue stress relaxation is well represented by a simple empirical equation involving a power law, t-beta (where t is time). Likewise, tissue impedance is well described by a model having a frequency-independent (constant) phase with impedance proportional to omega-alpha (where omega is angular frequency and alpha is a constant). These models provide superior descriptions over conventional spring-dashpot systems. Here we offer a mathematical framework and explore its mechanistic basis for using the power law relaxation function and constant-phase impedance. We show that replacing ordinary time derivatives with fractional time derivatives in the constitutive equation of conventional spring-dashpot systems naturally leads to power law relaxation function, the Fourier transform of which is the constant-phase impedance with alpha = 1 - beta. We further establish that fractional derivatives have a mechanistic basis with respect to the viscoelasticity of certain polymer systems. This mechanistic basis arises from molecular theories that take into account the complexity and statistical nature of the system at the molecular level. Moreover, because tissues are composed of long flexible biopolymers, we argue that these molecular theories may also apply for soft tissues. In our approach a key parameter is the exponent beta, which is shown to be directly related to dynamic processes at the tissue fiber and matrix level. By exploring statistical properties of various polymer systems, we offer a molecular basis for several salient features of the dynamic passive mechanical properties of soft tissues.},

abstract = {Weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) simulations of the reshocked two-dimensional single-mode Richtmyer–Meshkov instability using third-, fifth- and ninth-order spatial flux reconstruction and uniform grid resolutions corresponding to 128, 256 and 512 points per initial perturbation wavelength are presented. The dependence of the density, vorticity, simulated density Schlieren and baroclinic production fields, mixing layer width, circulation deposition, mixing profiles, production and mixing fractions, energy spectra, statistics, probability distribution functions, numerical turbulent kinetic energy and enstrophy production/dissipation rates, numerical Reynolds numbers, and numerical viscosity on the order and resolution is investigated to long evolution times. The results are interpreted using the implicit numerical dissipation in the characteristic projection-based, finite-difference WENO method. It is shown that higher-order higher-resolution simulations have lower numerical dissipation. The sensitivity of the quantities considered to the order and resolution is further amplified following reshock, when the energy deposition by the second shock-interface interaction induces the formation of small-scale structures. Lower-order lower-resolution simulations preserve large-scale structures and flow symmetry to late times, while higher-order higher-resolution simulations exhibit fragmentation of the structures, symmetry breaking and increased mixing. Similar flow features are qualitatively and quantitatively captured by either approximately doubling the order or the resolution. Additionally, the computational scaling shows that increasing the order is more advantageous than increasing the resolution for the flow considered here. The present investigation suggests that the ninth-order WENO method is well-suited for the simulation and analysis of complex multi-scale flows and mixing generated by shock-induced hydrodynamic instabilities.},

Effective switching between center-difference and limiter schemes is achieved by a set of robust tolerance and Lax-entropy based criterion [18]. Oscillations that could result from a mixed stencil scheme are minimized by requiring that the limiter method approaches the center-difference method in smooth regions. To achieve this the limiter is based on a norm of the deviation of WENO reconstruction weights from ideal. Results from a spatially 4th order version of the methodology are presented in one and two dimensions utilizing the California Institute of Technology's VTF (Virtual Test Facility) AMROC [7] software.},

The question posed by HIFT, whether at such global ranges the signals would permit phase-coherent processing and thus yield favorable signal-to-noise levels, was answered in the affirmative. There was no evidence of distress by the local marine mammal population in response to the acoustic transmissions. HIFT was prerequisite to a program for Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC).

abstract = {When focused ultrasound waves of moderate intensity in liquid encounter an air interface, a chain of drops emerges from the liquid surface to form what is known as a drop-chain fountain. Atomization, or the emission of micro-droplets, occurs when the acoustic intensity exceeds a liquid-dependent threshold. While the cavitation-wave hypothesis, which states that atomization arises from a combination of capillary-wave instabilities and cavitation bubble oscillations, is currently the most accepted theory of atomization, more data on the roles of cavitation, capillary waves, and even heat deposition or boiling would be valuable. In this paper, we experimentally test whether bubbles are a significant mechanism of atomization in drop-chain fountains. High-speed photography was used to observe the formation and atomization of drop-chain fountains composed of water and other liquids. For a range of ultrasonic frequencies and liquid sound speeds, it was found that the drop diameters approximately equalled the ultrasonic wavelengths. When water was exchanged for other liquids, it was observed that the atomization threshold increased with shear viscosity. Upon heating water, it was found that the time to commence atomization decreased with increasing temperature. Finally, water was atomized in an overpressure chamber where it was found that atomization was significantly diminished when the static pressure was increased. These results indicate that bubbles, generated by either acoustic cavitation or boiling, contribute significantly to atomization in the drop-chain fountain.},

abstract = {Diagnostic ultrasound can induce pulmonary capillary hemorrhage (PCH) in rats and other mammals. This phenomenon represents the only clearly demonstrated biological effect of (non-contrast enhanced) diagnostic ultrasound and thus presents a uniquely important safety issue. However, the physical mechanism responsible for PCH remains uncertain more than 25 y after its discovery. Experimental research has indicated that neither heating nor acoustic cavitation, the predominant mechanisms for bioeffects of ultrasound, is responsible for PCH. Furthermore, proposed theoretical mechanisms based on gas-body activation, on alveolar resonance and on impulsive generation of liquid droplets all appear unlikely to be responsible for PCH, owing to unrealistic model assumptions. Here, a simple model based on the acoustical radiation surface pressure (ARSP) at a tissue-air interface is hypothesized as the mechanism for PCH. The ARSP model seems to explain some features of PCH, including the approximate frequency independence of PCH thresholds and the dependence of thresholds on biological factors. However, ARSP evaluated for experimental threshold conditions appear to be too weak to fully account for stress failure of pulmonary capillaries, gauging by known stresses for injurious physiologic conditions. Furthermore, consideration of bulk properties of lung tissue suggests substantial transmission of ultrasound through the pleura, with reduced ARSP and potential involvement of additional mechanisms within the pulmonary interior. Although these recent findings advance our knowledge, only a full understanding of PCH mechanisms will allow development of science-based safety assurance for pulmonary ultrasound.},

abstract = {Of the three southern continents, South America was more isolated during the Tertiary than Africa, less isolated than Australia. Its record of Cenozoic mammalian life is better than that of either. This record suggests that around the beginning of the Cenozoic, South America received a few wait immigrants-marsupials, edentates, ungulates-that reached the continent across a water barrier. The source area was probably Central America, which formed a tropical North American peninsula until near the end of Tertiary time. A few later wait immigrants reached the continent across the water barrier-rodents in the later part of the Eocene, primates then or in the early Oligocene, and procyonids perhaps late in the Miocene. From the descendants of these few immigrants a balanced fauna evolved that was strikingly different in composition from those of other continents. The evolution of the various groups composing it is briefly presented and discussed. At the end of the Tertiary the isolation of the continent ended with the establishment of the Isthmus of Panama. Faunal interchange between North and South America then began and is still going on. Most of the northern participants in the interchange penetrated deeply into South America. The southern participants, advancing into a continent subjected to periodic continental glaciations, were less successful, the majority of them not penetrating beyond the tropical area. Competition and extinction during the faunal interchange went on mainly among the carnivores, the southern marsupials being replaced by the northern placentals. The spectacular extinctions, involving mainly large mammals of both northern and southern ancestry, came at the end of the Pleistocene; the arrival of man was probably a major factor.},

The technique implicitly assumes independent input parameters and is based on finding the optimum spatial shift between field calculations completed at two different values of each uncertain parameter. This shift information is used to convert uncertain-environmental-parameter distributions into PDF(A). The technique's accuracy is good when the shifted fields match well. Its accuracy is evaluated in range-independent underwater sound channels via an L(1) error-norm defined between approximate and numerically converged results for PDF(A). In 50-m- and 100-m-deep sound channels with 0.5{\%} uncertainty in depth (N=1) at frequencies between 100 and 800 Hz, and for ranges from 1 to 8 km, 95{\%} of the approximate field-amplitude distributions generated L(1) values less than 0.52 using only two field calculations. Obtaining comparable accuracy from traditional methods requires of order 10 field calculations and up to 10(N) when N{\textgreater}1.},

abstract = {The number of alveoli is a key structural determinant of lung architecture. A design-based stereologic approach was used for the direct and unbiased estimation of alveolar number in the human lung. The principle is based on two-dimensional topology in three-dimensional space and is free of assumptions on the shape, size, or spatial orientation of alveoli. Alveolar number is estimated by counting their openings at the level of the free septal edges, where they form a two-dimensional network. Mathematically, the Euler number of this network is estimated using physical disectors at a light microscopic level. In six adult human lungs, the mean alveolar number was 480 million (range: 274–790 million; coefficient of variation: 37{\%}). Alveolar number was closely related to total lung volume, with larger lungs having considerably more alveoli. The mean size of a single alveolus was rather constant with 4.2 × 106$\mu$m3 (range: 3.3–4.8 × 106$\mu$m3; coefficient of variation: 10{\%}), irrespective of the lung size. One cubic m...},

Fresh bovine tissues were investigated, including calfskin, liver, cardiac muscle, and striated muscle. Because of the very large shear wave attenuation coefficients, reasonably accurate determinations of shear wave properties are difficult to make. The quantity measured directly was the complex reflection coefficient for shear waves at a planar interface between the sample and fused silica. Measurements were made at frequencies spanning the range 2-14 MHz. The shear wave attenuation coefficients increase with frequency and are of the order of 10(4) times the longitudinal wave attenuation coefficients. The shear wave speeds of sound also increase with frequency but are only a few percent of the longitudinal wave speeds of sound. The results are accurate enough to allow frequency dependencies to be proposed.},

@article{Miller2015a,
abstract = {Pulmonary ultrasound examination has become routine for diagnosis in many clinical and point-of-care medical settings. However, the phenomenon of pulmonary capillary hemorrhage (PCH) induction during diagnostic ultrasound imaging presents a poorly understood risk factor. PCH was observed in anesthetized rats exposed to 1.5-, 4.5- and 12.0-MHz diagnostic ultrasound to investigate the frequency dependence of PCH thresholds. PCH was detected in the ultrasound images as growing comet tail artifacts and was assessed using photographs of the surface of excised lungs. Previous photographs acquired after exposure to 7.6-MHz diagnostic ultrasound were included for analysis. In addition, at each frequency we measured dosimetric parameters, including peak rarefactional pressure amplitude and spatial peak, pulse average intensity attenuated by rat chest wall samples. Peak rarefactional pressure amplitude thresholds determined at each frequency, based on the proportion of PCH in groups of five rats, were 1.03 ± 0.02, 1.28 ± 0.14, 1.18 ± 0.12 and 1.36 ± 0.15 MPa at 1.5, 4.5, 7.6 and 12.0 MHz, respectively. Although the PCH lesions decreased in size with increasing ultrasonic frequency, owing to the smaller beam widths and scan lengths, the peak rarefactional pressure amplitude thresholds remained approximately constant. This dependence was different from that of the mechanical index, which indicates a need for a specific dosimetric parameter for safety guidance in pulmonary ultrasound.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to further assess the role of inertial cavitation in ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage by examining the effect of pulse polarity at a common in situ (at the lung surface) peak rarefactional pressure [p r(in situ) ] and at a common in situ pulse intensity integral ( PII in situ ). A total of 60 rats was divided into three experimental groups of 20 animals per group and randomly exposed to pulsed ultrasound. The groups were exposed as follows: Group 1 to 0° polarity pulses (compression followed by rarefraction) at a p r(in situ) of 3.48 MPa and a PII in situ of 4.78 Ws/m2, group 2 to 180° polarity pulses (rarefraction followed by compression) at a p r(in situ) of 3.72 MPa and a PII in situ of 2.55 Ws/m2, and group 3 to 180° polarity pulses at a p r(in situ) of 4.97 MPa and a PII in situ of 4.79 Ws/m2. For all experimental groups, the frequency was 2.46 MHz, the exposure duration was 240 s, the pulse repetition frequency was 2.5 kHz, and the pulse duration was 0.42 $\mu$s. Six sham animals were also randomly distributed among the experimental animals. The lesion surface area and depth were determined for each rat as well as lesion occurrence (percentage of rats with lesions) per group. It was found that lesion occurrence and size correlated better with PII in situ than with p r(in situ) , suggesting that a mechanism other than inertial cavitation was responsible for the damage.},

abstract = {An accurate treatment of material interfaces in compressible multiphase flows poses important challenges for high-resolution numerical methods. Although high-order interface-capturing schemes have been used to accurately simulate gas/liquid interfaces with the Euler equations, these methods can result in temperature spikes at material discontinuities. While this phenomenon is not problematic for Euler simulations, it gives rise to numerical errors when heat conduction is included. In this work, we identify the source of these errors and propose a methodology to prevent their occurrence for various models used to represent gas/liquid interfaces in compressible flows based on a “single-fluid” formulation, in which interfaces are represented by discontinuities in the material properties. Our focus lies in materials (gases and liquids primarily, but also solids) that can be described by a stiffened equation of state, though our approach is generalizable to other equations. We show that numerical approaches that prevent pressure oscillations at interfaces may generate temperature errors, which affect the energy (and pressure) through the heat conduction term. We demonstrate that the material properties entering the equation of state must be computed according to suitable transport equations in conservative or non-conservative forms; the pressure and temperature must be calculated based on the appropriate properties. To verify the analysis and compute problems with gas/liquid interfaces of relevance, we develop a three-dimensional, high-order accurate, solution-adaptive finite difference framework. In particular, we show that temperatures and pressures may be significantly overestimated in calculations of shock-induced bubble collapse in water if temperature errors are not prevented.},

@article{OBrien1997a,
abstract = {The principal motivation of the study was to assess experimentally the question: "Is the MI (Mechanical Index) an equivalent or better indicator of nonthermal bioeffect risk than I(SPPA.3) (derated spatial peak, pulse average intensity)?" To evaluate this question, the experimental design consisted of a reproducible biological effect in order to provide a quantitative assessment of the effect. The specific biological effect used was lung damage and the species chosen was the rabbit. This work was initiated, in part, by a study in which lung hemorrhage was observed in 7-week old C3H mice for diagnostic-type, pulsed-wave ultrasound exposures, and, therefore, 6- to 7-week old C3H mice were used in this study as positive controls. Forty-seven adult New Zealand White male rabbits were exposed to a wide range of ultrasound amplitude conditions at center frequencies of 3 and 6 MHz with all temporal exposure variables held constant. A calibrated, commercial diagnostic ultrasound system was used as the ultrasound source with output levels exceeding, in some cases, permissible FDA levels. The MI was shown to be at least an equivalent, and in some cases, a better indicator of rabbit lung damage than either the I(SPPA.3) or p(r.3) (derated peak rarefactional pressure), thus answering the posed question positively. Further, in situ exposure conditions were estimated at the lung pleural surface (PS); the estimated in situ I(SPPA.PS) and p(r.PS) exposure conditions tracked lung damage no better than I(SPPA.3) and p(r.3), respectively, whereas the estimated in situ MI(PS) exposure condition was a slightly poorer predictor of lung damage than MI. Finally, the lungs of six adult crossbred pigs were exposed at the highest amplitude exposure levels permitted by a diagnostic ultrasound system (to prevent probe damage) at both frequencies; no lung damage was observed which suggests the possibility of a species dependency biological effect.},

abstract = {To evaluate the dynamic range of tissue imaged by elastography, the mechanical behavior of breast and prostate tissue samples subject to compression loading has been investigated. A model for the loading was validated and used to guide the experimental design for data collection. The model allowed the use of small samples that could be considered homogeneous; this assumption was confirmed by histological analysis. The samples were tested at three strain rates to evaluate the viscoelastic nature of the material and determine the validity of modeling the tissue as an elastic material for the strain rates of interest. For loading frequencies above 1 Hz, the storage modulus accounted for over 93 percent of the complex modulus. The data show that breast fat tissue has a constant modulus over the strain range tested while the other tissues have a modulus that is dependent on the strain level. The fibrous tissue samples from the breast were found to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude stiffer than fat tissue. Normal glandular breast tissue was found to have an elastic modulus similar to that of fat at low strain levels, but the modulus of the glandular tissue increased by an order of magnitude above fat at high strain levels. Carcinomas from the breast were stiffer than the other tissues at the higher strain level; intraductal in situ carcinomas were like fat at the low strain level and much stiffer than glandular tissue at the high strain level. Infiltrating ductal carcinomas were much stiffer than any of the other breast tissues. Normal prostate tissue has a modulus that is lower than the modulus of the prostate cancers tested. Tissue from prostate with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) had modulus values significantly lower than normal tissue. There was a constant but not significant difference in the modulus of tissues taken from the anterior and posterior portions of the gland.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to assess the threshold and superthreshold behavior of ultrasound (US)-induced lung hemorrhage in adult rabbits to gain greater understanding about species dependency. A total of 99 76 ?? 7.6-d-old 2.4 ?? 0.14-kg New Zealand White rabbits were used. Exposure conditions were 5.6-MHz, 10-s exposure duration, 1-kHz PRF and 1.1-??s pulse duration. The in situ (at the pleural surface) peak rarefactional pressure, pr(in situ), ranged between 1.5 and 8.4 MPa, with nine acoustic US exposure groups plus a sham exposure group. Rabbits were assigned randomly to the 10 groups, each with 10 rabbits, except for one group that had nine rabbits. Rabbits were exposed bilaterally with the order of exposure (left then right lung, or right then left lung) and acoustic pressure both randomized. Individuals involved in animal handling, exposure and lesion scoring were blinded to the exposure condition. Probit regression analysis was used to examine the dependence of the lesion occurrence on in situ peak rarefactional pressure and order of exposure (first vs. second). Likewise, lesion depth and lesion root surface area were analyzed using Gaussian tobit regression analysis. Neither probability of a lesion nor lesion size measurements was found to be statistically dependent on the order of exposure after the effect of pr(in situ) was considered. Also, a significant correlation was not detected between the two exposed lung sides on the same rabbit in either lesion occurrence or size measures. The pr(in situ) threshold estimates (in MPa) were similar to each other across occurrence (3.54 ?? 0.78), depth (3.36 ?? 0.73) and surface area (3.43 ?? 0.77) of lesions. Using the same experimental techniques and statistical approach, great consistency of thresholds was demonstrated across three species (mouse, rat and rabbit). Further, there were no differences in the biologic mechanism of injury induced by US and US-induced lesions were similar in morphology in all species and age groups studied. The extent of US-induced lung damage and the ability of the lung to heal led to the conclusion that, although US can produce lung damage at clinical levels, the degree of damage does not appear to be a significant medical problem.

abstract = {Diagnostic ultrasound contrast agents have been developed for enhancing the echogenicity of blood and for delineating other structures of the body. Approved agents are suspensions of gas bodies (stabilized microbubbles), which have been designed for persistence in the circulation and strong echo return for imaging. The interaction of ultrasound pulses with these gas bodies is a form of acoustic cavitation, and they also may act as inertial cavitation nuclei. This interaction produces mechanical perturbation and a potential for bioeffects on nearby cells or tissues. In vitro, sonoporation and cell death occur at mechanical index (MI) values less than the inertial cavitation threshold. In vivo, bioeffects reported for MI values greater than 0.4 include microvascular leakage, petechiae, cardiomyocyte death, inflammatory cell infiltration, and premature ventricular contractions and are accompanied by gas body destruction within the capillary bed. Bioeffects for MIs of 1.9 or less have been reported in skeletal muscle, fat, myocardium, kidney, liver, and intestine. Therapeutic applications that rely on these bioeffects include targeted drug delivery to the interstitium and DNA transfer into cells for gene therapy. Bioeffects of contrast-aided diagnostic ultrasound happen on a microscopic scale, and their importance in the clinical setting remains uncertain.},

abstract = {These studies documented the presence or absence of macroscopic and microscopic intraparenchymal hemorrhage in individual lung lobes of mice, rabbits, and pigs exposed to continuous- and pulsed-wave (diagnostic) ultrasound; we described the character of and lesions associated with the hemorrhage and compared differences in the lesions among species and exposure conditions to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms and species differences associated with ultrasound-induced lung hemorrhage. In a series of three sequential interdependent studies, 312 mice, 91 rabbits, and 74 pigs were divided at random into experimental groups and exposed to continuous-wave ultrasound (3 kHz modulated at 120 Hz) of acoustic pressure levels ranging from 0 to 490 kPa for 5, 10, or 20 minutes. In a fourth study, three mice, 43 rabbits, and six pigs were divided at random into experimental groups and exposed to pulsed-wave ultrasound (3- and 6-MHz center frequency) of peak rarefactional acoustic pressure levels ranging from 0 to 5.6 MPa for 5 minutes. Macroscopic lesions induced by continuous- and pulsed-wave ultrasound consisted of dark red to black areas of hemorrhage that extended from visceral pleural surfaces into lung parenchyma. Hemorrhage appeared spatially related to the edges of lung lobes where pleura of dorsal and ventral surfaces met, occurred in specific lung lobes in all three species, and appeared anatomically related to lung that was closest to and in contiguous alignment with the ultrasound transducer and thus the path of the sound beam. Macroscopic lesions were similar in all species under all exposure conditions for both continuous- and pulsed-wave ultrasound; however, hemorrhage was not induced in pig lung exposed to pulsed-wave ultrasound at any peak rarefactional acoustic pressure level. Eighteen mice (145 kPa exposure pressure), 60 rabbits (145-460 kPa exposure pressure), and 58 pigs (145-490 kPa exposure pressure) from study 3 were used for microscopic evaluation of lung exposed to continuous-wave ultrasound; three mice (6 MHz; 2.9 and 5.4 MPa), 39 rabbits (3 and 6 MHz; 2.3-5.4 MPa), and six pigs (3 and 6 MHz; 3.3, 5.4, and 5.6 MPa) from study 4 were used for microscopic evaluation of lung exposed to pulsed-wave ultrasound. Microscopic lesions and the character of hemorrhage induced by continuous-wave ultrasound were different from those induced by pulsed-wave ultrasound. Lesions induced by continuous-wave ultrasound under all exposure conditions were similar in all three species. Lesions induced by pulsed-wave ultrasound under all exposure conditions were similar in all three species.},

abstract = {Dental thermal pain is a significant health problem in daily life and dentistry. There is a long-standing question regarding the phenomenon that cold stimulation evokes sharper and more shooting pain sensations than hot stimulation. This phenomenon, however, outlives the well-known hydrodynamic theory used to explain dental thermal pain mechanism. Here, we present a mathematical model based on the hypothesis that hot or cold stimulation-induced different directions of dentinal fluid flow and the corresponding odontoblast movements in dentinal microtubules contribute to different dental pain responses. We coupled a computational fluid dynamics model, describing the fluid mechanics in dentinal microtubules, with a modified Hodgkin-Huxley model, describing the discharge behavior of intradental neuron. The simulated results agreed well with existing experimental measurements. We thence demonstrated theoretically that intradental mechano-sensitive nociceptors are not "equally sensitive" to inward (into the pulp) and outward (away from the pulp) fluid flows, providing mechanistic insights into the difference between hot and cold dental pain. The model developed here could enable better diagnosis in endodontics which requires an understanding of pulpal histology, neurology and physiology, as well as their dynamic response to the thermal stimulation used in dental practices.},

abstract = {A simple interface-capturing approach proposed previously by the author for efficient numerical resolution of multicomponent problems with a van der Waals fluid [J. Comput. Phys., 156 (1999), pp. 43–88] is extended to a more general case with real materials characterized by a Mie–Gr{\"{u}}neisen equation of state. As before, the flow regime of interests is assumed to be homogeneous with no jumps in the pressure and velocity (the normal component of it) across the interfaces that separate two regions of different fluid components. The algorithm uses a mixture type of the model system that is formed by combining the Euler equations of gas dynamics for the basic conserved variables and an additional set of effective equations for the problem-dependent material quantities. In this approach, the latter equations are introduced in the algorithm primarily for an easy computation of the pressure from the equation of state, and are derived so as to ensure a consistent modeling of the energy equation near the interfaces where two or more fluid components are present in a grid cell, and also the fulfillment of the mass equation in the other single component regions. A standard high-resolution wave propagation method designed originally for single component flows is generalized to solve the proposed system for multicomponent flows, giving an efficient implementation of the algorithm. Several numerical results are presented in both one and two space dimensions that show the feasibility of the method with the Roe Riemann solver as applied to a reasonable class of practical problems without introducing any spurious oscillations in the pressure near the interfaces. This includes results obtained using a multicomponent version of the AMRCLAW software package of Berger and LeVeque for the simulation of the impact of an underwater aluminum plate to a copper plate in two space dimensions.},

abstract = {In this work, a novel thiol-ene based photopolymerizable resin formulation was shown to exhibit highly desirable characteristics, such as low cure time and the ability to overcome oxygen inhibition, for the photolithographic fabrication of microfluidic devices. The feature fidelity, as well as various aspects of the feature shape and quality, were assessed as functions of various resin attributes, particularly the exposure conditions, initiator concentration and inhibitor to initiator ratio. An optical technique was utilized to evaluate the feature fidelity as well as the feature shape and quality. These results were used to optimize the thiol-ene resin formulation to produce high fidelity, high aspect ratio features without significant reductions in feature quality. For structures with aspect ratios below 2, little difference ({\textless}3{\%}) in feature quality was observed between thiol-ene and acrylate based formulations. However, at higher aspect ratios, the thiol-ene resin exhibited significantly improved feature quality. At an aspect ratio of 8, raised feature quality for the thiol-ene resin was dramatically better than that achieved by using the acrylate resin. The use of the thiol-ene based resin enabled fabrication of a pinched-flow microfluidic device that has complex channel geometry, small (50 $\mu$m) channel dimensions, and high aspect ratio (14) features.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Computed tomography measurements of chest wall thickness (CWT) suggest that standard-length angiocatheters (4.5 cm) may fail to decompress tension pneumothoraces. We used an alternative modality, ultrasound, to measure CWT. We correlated CWT with body mass index (BMI) and used national data to estimate the percentage of patients with CWT greater than 4.5 cm. METHODS This was an observational, cross-sectional study of a convenience sample. We recorded standing height, weight, and sex. We measured CWT with ultrasound at the second intercostal space, midclavicular line and at the fourth intercostal space, midaxillary line on supine subjects. We correlated BMI (weight [in kilograms]/height(2) [in square meters]) with CWT using linear regression. 95{\%} Confidence intervals (CIs) assessed statistical significance. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey results for 2007-2008 were combined to estimate national BMI adult measurements. RESULTS Of 51 subjects, 33 (65{\%}) were male and 18 (35{\%}) were female. Mean anterior CWT (male, 2.1 cm; CI, 1.9-2.3; female, 2.3 cm; CI, 1.7-2.7), lateral CWT (male, 2.4 cm; CI, 2.1-2.6; female, 2.5 cm; CI 2.0-2.9), and BMI (male, 27.7; CI, 26.1-29.3; female, 30.0; CI, 25.8-34.2) did not differ by sex. Lateral CWT was greater than anterior CWT (0.2 cm; CI, 0.1-0.4; P {\textless} .01). Only one subject with a BMI of 48.2 had a CWT that exceeded 4.5 cm. Using national BMI estimates, less than 1{\%} of the US population would be expected to have CWT greater than 4.5 cm. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound measurements suggest that most patients will have CWT less than 4.5 cm and that CWT may not be the source of the high failure rate of needle decompression in tension pneumothorax.},

abstract = {Alveolar septa, which have often been modeled as linear elements, may distend due to inflation-induced reduction in slack or increase in tissue stretch. The distended septum supports tissue elastic and interfacial forces. An effective Young's modulus, describing the inflation-induced relative displacement of septal end points, has not been determined in situ for lack of a means of determining the forces supported by septa in situ. Here we determine such forces indirectly according to Mead, Takishima, and Leith's classic lung mechanics analysis (J Appl Physiol 28: 596-608, 1970), which demonstrates that septal connections transmit the transpulmonary pressure, PTP, from the pleural surface to interior regions. We combine experimental septal strain determination and computational stress determination, according to Mead et al., to calculate effective Young's modulus. In the isolated, perfused rat lung, we label the perfusate with fluorescence to visualize the alveolar septa. At eight PTP values around a ventilation loop between 4 and 25 cmH2O, and upon total deflation, we image the same region by confocal microscopy. Within an analysis region, we measure septal lengths. Normalizing by unstressed lengths at total deflation, we calculate septal strains for all PTP {\textgreater} 0 cmH2O. For the static imaging conditions, we computationally model application of PTP to the boundary of the analysis region and solve for septal stresses by least squares fit of an overdetermined system. From group septal strain and stress values, we find effective septal Young's modulus to range from 1.2 × 10(5) dyn/cm(2) at low P(TP) to 1.4 × 10(6) dyn/cm(2) at high P(TP).},

abstract = {An analysis of experimental data on the pulmonary alveolar sheet of the cat shows: (1) As far as elasticity in the plane of the sheet is concerned, the alveolar sheet may be regarded as uniform; the compliance of the posts is the same as that of the membranes. (2) Within a physiological range of positive transmural pressure, the mean thickness of the sheet varies linearly with the pressure. Also, the stress distribution in the alveolar-capillary membrane is nonuniform and nonisotropic. A theoretical sheet thickness-pressure relationship is derived in which the effect of stress resultants (sum of elastic stress and surface tension) is explicitly linked to the compliance of the sheet thickness. The sheet-flow theory then shows that average flow is very sensitive to the arteriole pressure. The flow per alveolar sheet is (1/C) (ha4 -- hv4). Here ha and hv are equal to alveolar sheet thickness at the arteriole and venule, respectively. When art {\textgreater} alv, ha = h0 + {\{}alpha{\}}(art - alv), where art is the blood pressure in the sheet at the arteriole, alv is the gas pressure in the alveolus, {\{}alpha{\}} is the compliance constant for the sheet thickness, and h0 is the thickness at {\{}Delta{\}} = 0. The constant C = 4{\{}micro{\}}f L{\{}alpha{\}}/ (SA), where {\{}micro{\}} is the coefficient of viscosity of blood, f is a friction parameter (on the order of 4, depending on the post geometry), L is the average length of the streamlines in the sheet, S is the vascular space-tissue ratio (on the order of 0.9), and A is the sheet area. Comparison of this formula with the experimental results of Roos et al., using h0 and {\{}alpha{\}} values from Glazier et al., shows reasonable agreement.},

The acoustic data were collected on the New Jersey continental shelf during shallow water experiments in August 2006. The oceanographic variability was evident when the data were recorded. To quantify the uncertainties of the geoacoustic parameter estimates in this environment, Bayesian matched field geoacoustic inversion was applied to multi-tonal continuous wave data. The spatially and temporally varying water column sound speed is parametrized in terms of empirical orthogonal functions and included in the inversion. Its impact on the geometric and geoacoustic parameter estimates is then analyzed by the inter-parameter correlations. Two different approaches were used to obtain information about the variation of the water sound speed. One used only the profiles collected along the experimental track during the experiment, and the other also included observations collected over a larger area. The geoacoustic estimates from both the large and small sample sets are consistent. However, due to the diversity of the oceanic sound speed, more empirical orthogonal functions are needed in the inversion when more sound speed profile samples are used.},

abstract = {The threshold for generation of lung hemorrhage in adult mice by pulsed ultrasound has been shown to be approximately 1 MPa at the surface of the lung (10-$\mu$s pulse and a carrier frequency of 2 MHz). This investigation used neonatal swine to determine if the findings for mice can be generalized to other species. After exploratory observations, the inverse sampling method was used in a primary study (22 animals, 88 exposure sites) to determine the threshold for lung hemorrhage in neonatal swine. The primary study was followed by a separate confirmation study (13 animals, 48 exposure sites), testing the conclusions of the first study and comparing damage at subthreshold levels with sham-exposed animals. A separate investigation explored the histological nature of tissue damage at suprathreshold levels. A 2.3-MHz focused transducer (10 $\mu$s at 100-Hz pulse-repetition frequency) was incremented vertically for a distance of 2 cm over the chest of the subject for a total exposure period of 16 min. Animals were euthanized and lungs were scored by visual inspection for numbers and areas of gross hemorrhages. The threshold level for hemorrhage was approximately 1.5 MPa peak positive pressure in water at the surface of the animal or, at the surface of the lung, 1.1 MPa peak positive pressure, 1 MPa fundamental pressure, 0.9 MPa maximum negative pressure, 25 W cm−2 pulse average intensity or a mechanical index of 0.6.

abstract = {Understanding the behavior of cavitation bubbles driven by ultrasonic fields is an important problem in biomedical acoustics. Keller-Miksis equation, which can account for the large amplitude oscillations of bubbles, is rederived in this paper and combined with a viscoelastic model to account for the strain-stress relation. The viscoelastic model used in this study is the Voigt model. It is shown that only the viscous damping term in the original equation needs to be modified to account for the effect of elasticity. With experiment determined viscoelastic properties, the effects of elasticity on bubble oscillations are studied. Specifically, the inertial cavitation thresholds are determined using R(max)/R(0), and subharmonic signals from the emission of an oscillating bubble are estimated. The results show that the presence of the elasticity increases the threshold pressure for a bubble to oscillate inertially, and subharmonic signals may only be detectable in certain ranges of radius and pressure amplitude. These results should be easy to verify experimentally, and they may also be useful in cavitation detection and bubble-enhanced imaging.},

abstract = {A high-order accurate shock- and interface-capturing scheme is used to simulate the collapse of a gas bubble in water. In order to better understand the damage caused by collapsing bubbles, the dynamics of the shock-induced and Rayleigh collapse of a bubble near a planar rigid surface and in a free field are analysed. Collapse times, bubble displacements, interfacial velocities and surface pressures are quantified as a function of the pressure ratio driving the collapse and of the initial bubble stand-off distance from the wall; these quantities are compared to the available theory and experiments and show good agreement with the data for both the bubble dynamics and the propagation of the shock emitted upon the collapse. Non-spherical collapse involves the formation of a re-entrant jet directed towards the wall or in the direction of propagation of the incoming shock. In shock-induced collapse, very high jet velocities can be achieved, and the finite time for shock propagation through the bubble may be non-negligible compared to the collapse time for the pressure ratios of interest. Several types of shock waves are generated during the collapse, including precursor and water-hammer shocks that arise from the re-entrant jet formation and its impact upon the distal side of the bubble, respectively. The water-hammer shock can generate very high pressures on the wall, far exceeding those from the incident shock. The potential damage to the neighbouring surface is quantified by measuring the wall pressure. The range of stand-off distances and the surface area for which amplification of the incident shock due to bubble collapse occurs is determined.},

abstract = {Histotripsy is an ultrasound ablation method that controls cavitation to fractionate soft tissue. In order to effectively fractionate tissue, histotripsy requires cavitation bubbles to rapidly expand from nanometer-sized initial nuclei into bubbles often larger than 50 µm. Using a negative pressure high enough to initiate a bubble cloud and expand bubbles to a sufficient size, histotripsy has been shown capable of completely fractionating soft tissue into acelluar debris resulting in effective tissue removal. Previous work has shown that the histotripsy process is affected by tissue mechanical properties with stiffer tissues showing increased resistance to histotripsy fractionation, which we hypothesize to be caused by impeded bubble expansion in stiffer tissues. In this study, the hypothesis that increases in tissue stiffness cause a reduction in bubble expansion was investigated both theoretically and experimentally. High speed optical imaging was used to capture a series of time delayed images of bubbles produced inside mechanically tunable agarose tissue phantoms using histotripsy pulses produced by 345 kHz, 500 kHz, 1.5 MHz, and 3 MHz histotripsy transducers. The results demonstrated a significant decrease in maximum bubble radius (Rmax) and collapse time (tc) with both increasing Young's modulus and increasing frequency. Furthermore, results showed that Rmax was not increased by raising the pressure above the intrinsic threshold. Finally, this work demonstrated the potential of using a dual-frequency strategy to modulate the expansion of histotripsy bubbles. Overall, the results of this study improve our understanding of how tissue stiffness and ultrasound parameters affect histotripsy-induced bubble behavior and provide a rational basis to tailor acoustic parameters for treatment of the specific tissues of interest.},

While DUS for lung imaging is routine in critical care situations, a fundamental understanding of DUS-induced LH remains lacking. The objective of this study is to numerically simulate DUS-lung interaction to identify potential damage mechanisms, with an emphasis on shear. Experimentally relevant ultrasound waveforms of different frequencies and amplitudes propagate in tissue (modeled as water) and interact with the lung (modeled as air). Different length scales ranging from single capillaries to lung surface sizes are investigated. For the simulations, a high-order accurate discontinuity-capturing scheme solves the two-dimensional, compressible Navier-Stokes equations to obtain velocities, pressures, stresses and interface displacements in the entire domain. In agreement with theoretical acoustic approximations, small interface displacements are observed. At the lung surface, shear stresses indicative of high strains rates develop and are shown to increase nonlinearly with decreasing ratio of interface curvature to ultrasonic wavelength.},

Improvements to analytical and numerical models have led to critical insights into cavity formation, the depth and time of pinch-off, forces, and trajectories for myriad different impact parameters. This topic spans a wide range of regimes, from low-speed entry phenomena dominated by surface tension to high-speed ballistics, for which cavitation is important.

These cells participate in the maintenance of a delicate system regulated not only by biological factors but also by the mechanical environment of the lung, which undergoes dynamic deformation during breathing. Clinical and animal studies as well as cell culture studies point toward a strong influence of mechanical forces on lung cells and tissues including effects on growth and repair, surfactant release, injury, and inflammation. However, despite substantial advances in our understanding of lung mechanics over the last half century, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the micromechanics of the alveolus and how it deforms during lung inflation. Therefore, the aims of this review are to draw a multidisciplinary account of the mechanics of the alveolus on the basis of its structure, biology, and chemistry and to compare estimates of alveolar deformation from previous studies.},

abstract = {Objective. The purpose of this study was to identify the pressure threshold for the destruction of Optison (octafluoropropane contrast agent; Amersham Health, Princeton, NJ) using a laboratory-assembled 3.5-MHz pulsed ultrasound system and a clinical diagnostic ultrasound scanner. Methods. A 3.5-MHz focused transducer and a linear array with a center frequency of 6.9 MHz were positioned confocally and at 90{\{}degrees{\}} to each other in a tank of deionized water. Suspensions of Optison (5-8 x 104 microbubbles/mL) were insonated with 2-cycle pulses from the 3.5-MHz transducer (peak rarefactional pressure, or Pr, from 0.0, or inactive, to 0.6 MPa) while being interrogated with fundamental B-mode imaging pulses (mechanical index, or MI, = 0.04). Scattering received by the 3.5-MHz transducer or the linear array was quantified as mean backscattered intensity or mean digital intensity, respectively, and fit with exponential decay functions (Ae-kt + N, where A + N was the amplitude at time 0; N, background echogenicity; and k, decay constant). By analyzing the decay constants statistically, a pressure threshold for Optison destruction due to acoustically driven diffusion was identified. Results. The decay constants determined from quantified 3.5-MHz radio frequency data and B-mode images were in good agreement. The peak rarefactional pressure threshold for Optison destruction due to acoustically driven diffusion at 3.5 MHz was 0.15 MPa (MI = 0.08). Furthermore, the rate of Optison destruction increased with increasing 3.5-MHz exposure pressure output. Conclusions. Optison destruction was quantified with a laboratory-assembled 3.5-MHz ultrasound system and a clinical diagnostic ultrasound scanner. The pressure threshold for acoustically driven diffusion was identified, and 3 distinct mechanisms of ultrasound contrast agent destruction were observed with acoustic techniques.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to determine the ability of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEU) to quantify renal tissue perfusion. BACKGROUND The kinetics of tracers used to assess renal perfusion are often complicated by countercurrent exchange, tubular transport or glomerular filtration. We hypothesized that, because gas-filled microbubbles are pure intravascular tracers with a rheology similar to that of red blood cells, CEU could be used to quantify renal tissue perfusion. METHODS During a continuous venous infusion of microbubbles (SonoVue), regional renal perfusion was quantified in nine dogs using CEU by destroying microbubbles and measuring their tissue replenishment with intermittent harmonic imaging. Both renal blood volume fraction and microbubble velocity were derived from pulsing-interval versus video-intensity plots. The product of the two was used to calculate renal nutrient blood flow. Renal arterial blood flow was independently measured with ultrasonic flow probes placed directly on the renal artery and was increased using dopamine and decreased by placement of a renal artery stenosis. RESULTS An excellent correlation was found between cortical nutrient blood flow using microbubbles and ultrasonic flow probe-derived renal blood flow (r = 0.82, p {\textless} 0.001) over a wide range (2.5 fold) of flows. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound examination during microbubble infusion can be used to quantify total organ as well as regional nutrient blood flow to the kidney.},

abstract = {Recent observations of the collapse of single bubbles or clouds of cavities trapped within stationary acoustic fields have shown the production of light and these phenomena have been dubbed single-- or multiple--bubble sonoluminescence. The experimental observation of the variations in the bubble radius with time, with simultaneous measurement of the light emission from the bubble, shows short pulses of light correlated closely with the point of minimum radius of the bubble. Results will be presented showing experimental observations of light produced from shock--collapsed cavities. The role of shock waves generated within the bubble by the motion of the walls will be discussed with application to the shock--wave hypothesis proposed as one of the mechanisms responsible for sonoluminescence. The likely asymmetry of the process, as recently proposed, and the consequent presence of a high--velocity jet will also be discussed. The effect of such {\{}$\backslash$lq{\}}hot{\{}$\backslash$rq{\}} cavities within an explosive matrix is investigated and results are presented. The collapse of a single bubble shows that light emission from the explosive matrix is due to reaction caused by hydrodynamic heating by jet impact, not due to conduction from heated gas during compression. Similar results are seen in arrays of collapsing cavities. The effects of close, inert particles are discussed and an example is given.},

A hydrodynamic analysis, applying experimental data wherever possible, is used to show that small swimmers (roughly less than a metre long) are limited by the available power, while larger swimmers at a few metres below the water surface are limited by cavitation. Depending on the caudal fin cross-section, 10-15 m s(-1) is shown to be the maximum cavitation-free velocity for all swimmers at a shallow depth.},

@article{Truscott2014,
abstract = {The free-surface impact of solid objects has been investigated for well over a century. This canonical problem is influenced by many physical parameters, including projectile geometry, material properties, fluid properties, and impact parameters. Through advances in high-speed imaging and visualization techniques, discoveries about the underlying physics have improved our understanding of these phenomena. Improvements to analytical and numerical models have led to critical insights into cavity formation, the depth and time of pinch-off, forces, and trajectories for myriad different impact parameters. This topic spans a wide range of regimes, from low-speed entry phenomena dominated by surface tension to high-speed ballistics, for which cavitation is important. This review surveys experimental, theoretical, and numerical studies over this broad range, utilizing canonical images where possible to enhance intuition and insight into the rich phenomena.},

@article{Fujikawa1980,
abstract = {Analytical and numerical analyses have been made of the physical behaviour of a collapsing bubble in a liquid. The mathematical formulation takes into account the effects of compressibility of the liquid, non-equilibrium condensation of the ,apour, heat conduction and the temperature discontinuity at the phase interface. Numerical solutions for the collapse of the bubble are obtained beyond the time when the bubble reaches its minimum radius up to the stage when a pressure wave forms and propagates outward into the liquid. The numerical results indicate that evaporation and condensation strongly influence the dynamical behaviour of the bubble. In addition, the propagation of the stress wave, both in a solid and a liquid, due to the collapse of the bubble has been observed by means ofthe dynamic photoelasticity. It is clearly demonstrated that the stress wave in a photoelastic specimen is caused by impact of the pressure wave radiated from the bubble.},

@article{Oliver2013,
abstract = {The hunting strategies of pelagic thresher sharks (Alopias pelagicus) were investigated at Pescador Island in the Philippines. It has long been suspected that thresher sharks hunt with their scythe-like tails but the kinematics associated with the behaviour in the wild are poorly understood. From 61 observations recorded by handheld underwater video camera between June and October 2010, 25 thresher shark shunting events were analysed. Thresher sharks employed tail-slaps to debilitate sardines at all times of day. Hunting events comprised preparation, strike, wind-down recovery and prey item collection phases, which occurred sequentially. Preparation phases were significantly longer than the others, presumably to enable a shark to windup a tail-slap. Tail-slaps were initiated by an adduction of the pectoral fins, a manoeuvre that changed a thresher shark's pitch promoting its posterior region to lift rapidly, and stall its approach. Tail-slaps occurred with such force that they may have caused dissolved gas to diffuse out of the water column forming bubbles. Thresher sharks were able to consume more than one sardine at a time, suggesting that tail-slapping is an effective foraging strategy for hunting schooling prey. Pelagic thresher sharks appear to pursue sardines opportunistically by day and night, which may make them vulnerable to fisheries. Alopiids possess specialist pectoral and caudal fins that are likely to have evolved, at least in part, for tail-slapping. The evidence is now clear; thresher sharks really do hunt with their tails.},
