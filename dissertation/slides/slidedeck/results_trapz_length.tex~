  \begin{itemize}
  \item Changing wave width changes time when expansion hits interface
  \end{itemize}

  The length of the wave strongly effects the vorticity deposited and
  thus the long-term dynamics of the interface.

    Mauro's Questions:\\
    (1) Is there a way to non-dimensionalize this show that the
    transition of the physics occurs between $L = 20 - 30 \lambda$.
    (1A): This essentially boils down to figuring out the speed of the
    interface evolution and modeling the time at which the
    phase-inversion will occur.\\Maybe I should subtract
    $\Delta L_{lag}$ to see this better, or divide $\gamma$ by
    $a(t=t_{phase-reversal})^n$ or $\Delta L_{Lag}^n$.\\
    (2) What is the Reynolds number?
