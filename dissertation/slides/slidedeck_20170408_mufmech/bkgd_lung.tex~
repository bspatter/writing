    \item Lung Hemorrhage (LH) is the only known bioeffect of non-contrast DUS%
    \item Has been shown to occur in mice, rats, pigs, rabbits, monkeys \citep{Child1990,OBrien1997a,Tarantal1994a}.%
    \item DUS-induced LH does not appear to be a result of cavitation or heating.%
    \item The underlying physical damage mechanism is not understood.%
