  Summary:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item I studied the interaction of ultrasound pulses with gas-liquid interfaces similar to those in the alveoli.
  \end{itemize}

  Conclusions
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A single ultrasound pulse may be capable of appreciably deforming an alveolar wall before a subsequent pulse occurs.
  \item Viscous shear stresses generated by ultrasound are unlikely to be the cause of alveolar hemorrhage.
  \item Vorticity-induced strain may be capable of causing pulmonary
    hemorrhage, though more work that accounts for viscoelastic
    effects and multiple pulses is required.
  \end{itemize}
