  Summary:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We studied the interaction of finite-duration acoustic waves with gas-liquid interfaces.
  \end{itemize}

  Conclusions
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Baroclinic vorticity is generated acoustic wave-interface interactions%
  \item This vorticity appears to deforming perturbed liquid-gas interfaces.%
  \item The interface perturbation grows as $t^{3/5}$ and scales with linear circulation density along the interface $\Gamma_0 / s_0$.
  \item The interface arc length per unit circulation $s(t)/\Gamma(t)$ grows approximately as $t^{1/2}$ and scales with wave amplitude $p_a$.
  \item This may be a mechanism for ultrasound-induced alveolar strain and hemorrhage and should be studied further.
  \end{itemize}
