  \begin{itemize}
  \item Acoustically-generated baroclinic vorticity is likely capable
    of significantly deforming perturbed liquid gas interfaces.\vfill%
  \item Baroclinic vorticity is predominantly deposited in gaseous fluids.\vfill%
  \item Changes in the acoustic waveform that have little effect on
    the interface during the wave-interface interaction can
    substantially effect the interface over long periods of time, via
    vorticity.\vfill%
  \item Interface response from an US wave is qualitatively similar to that for a trapezoidal wave.
  \end{itemize}
