  Summary:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item I studied the interaction of finite-duration acoustic waves with gas-liquid interfaces.
  \end{itemize}

  Conclusions
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Acoustically generated baroclinic vorticity generated by wave-interface interaction is capable of deforming perturbed liquid-gas interfaces.\vfill%
  \item The interface perturbation grows as $t^{3/5}$ and scales with linear circulation density along the interface $\Gamma_0 / s_0$.
  \item The interface arc length per unit circulation $\s(t)/\Gamma(t)$ grows approximately as $t^{1/2}$ and scales with wave amplitude $p_a$.
  \item Circulation deposition depends on interface morphology and time-dependent wave features.
  \end{itemize}
